    "EMBEDDING -BASED RETRIEVAL WITH LLM FOR EFFECTIVE AGRICULTURE INFORMATION EXTRACTING FROM UNSTRUCTURED DATA": "Pest identification is a crucial aspect of pest control in agriculture. However, most farmers are not capable of accurately identifying pests in the field, and there is a limited number of structured data sources available for rapid querying. In this work, we explored using domain-agnostic general pre-trained large language model (LLM) to extract structured data from agricultural documents with minimal or no human intervention. We propose a methodology that involves text retrieval and filtering using embedding-based retrieval, followed by LLM question-answering to automatically extract entities and attributes from the documents, and transform them into structured data. In comparison to existing methods, our approach achieves consistently better accuracy in the benchmark while maintaining efficiency.",
    "IoT-Based Object-Detection System to Safeguard Endangered Animals and Bolster Agricultural Farm Security": "Signi\ufb01cant threats to ecological equilibrium and sustainable agriculture are posed by the extinction of animal species and the subsequent effects on farms. Farmers face dif\ufb01cult decisions, such as installing electric fences to protect their farms, although these measures can harm animals essential for maintaining ecological equilibrium. To tackle these essential issues, our research introduces an innovative solution in the form of an object-detection system. In this research, we designed and implemented a system that leverages the ESP32-CAM platform in conjunction with the YOLOv8 object-detection model. Our proposed system aims to identify endangered species and harmful animals within farming environments, providing real-time alerts to farmers and endangered wildlife by integrating a cloud-based alert system. To train the YOLOv8 model effectively, we meticulously compiled diverse image datasets featuring these animals in agricultural settings, subsequently annotating them. After that, we tuned the hyperparameter of the YOLOv8 model to enhance the performance of the model. The results from our optimized YOLOv8 model are auspicious. It achieves a remarkable",

    "ChatGPT for shaping the future of dentistry: the potential of multi-modal large language model": "The ChatGPT, a lite and conversational variant of Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT - 4) developed by OpenAI, is one of the milestone Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. LLMs have stirred up much interest among researchers and practitioners in their impressive skills in natural language processing tasks, which profoundly impact various \ufb01elds. This paper mainly discusses the future applications of LLMs in dentistry. We introduce two primary LLM deployment methods in dentistry, including automated dental diagnosis and cross - modal dental diagnosis, and examine their potential applications. Especially, equipped with a cross - modal encoder, a single LLM can manage multi - source data and conduct advanced natural language reasoning to perform complex clinical operations. We also present cases to demonstrate the potential of a fully automatic Multi - Modal LLM AI system for dentistry clinical application. While LLMs offer signi\ufb01cant potential bene\ufb01ts, the challenges, such as data privacy, data quality, and model bias, need further study. Overall, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize dental diagnosis and treatment, which indicates a promising avenue for clinical application and research in dentistry.",
    "Performance of ChatGPT on USMLE: Unlocking the Potential of Large Language Models for AI-Assisted Medical Education": "Artificial intelligence is gaining traction in more ways than ever before. The popularity of language models and AI-based businesses has soared since ChatGPT was made available to the general public via OpenAI. It is becoming increasingly common for people to use ChatGPT both professionally and personally. Considering the widespread use of ChatGPT and the reliance people place on it, this study determined how reliable ChatGPT can be for answering complex medical and clinical questions. Harvard University gross anatomy along with the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questionnaire were used to accomplish the objective. The paper evaluated the obtained results using a 2-way ANOVA and posthoc analysis. Both showed systematic covariation between format and prompt. Furthermore, the physician adjudicators independently rated the outcome's accuracy, concordance, and insight. As a result of the analysis, ChatGPT-generated answers were found to be more context-oriented and represented a better model for deductive reasoning than regular Google search results. Furthermore, ChatGPT obtained 58.8% on logical questions and 60% on ethical questions. This means that the ChatGPT is approaching the passing range for logical questions and has crossed the threshold for ethical questions. The paper believes ChatGPT and other language learning models can be invaluable tools for e-learners; however, the study suggests that there is still room to improve their accuracy. In order to improve ChatGPT's performance in the future, further research is needed to better understand how it can answer different types of questions.",
    "Domain-Specific Language Model Pretraining for Biomedical Natural Language Processing": "Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly-available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition (NER). To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding & Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.",
    "Foresight - Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) for Modelling of Patient Timelines using EHRs": "Evidence before this study: We reviewed published evidence using Google Scholar and PubMed for studies using transformer-based models for forecasting patient timelines. We used the terms (\"transformer\" OR \"bert\" OR \"generative pretrained transformer\") AND (\"forecasting\" OR \"temporal modelling\" OR \"trajectory\") AND (\"ehr\" OR \"health records\" OR \"medical records\" OR \"healthcare\" OR \"medicine\" OR \"patients\" OR \"hospital\" OR \"clinical\"), the scope was anywhere in the text, published in 2018 or later. We found many CoVid - 19 studies, or studies that focus on a specific biomedical concept or set of concepts. A few studies focus on forecasting a wider range of biomedical concepts, but still require structured data, work with specific timeframes or can only forecast one step into the future. Added value of this study: Foresight can use unstructured and structured data, can work with different temporal resolutions (e.g. day, week, month) and because it is a generative model, in theory, it can simulate the patient's journey until death. Foresight was tested across hospitals, covering both physical and mental health, and 5 clinicians performed an independent test by simulating patients and outcomes. The tests were not focused on specific disorders or biomedical concepts but cover a broad range of concepts from the SNOMED ontology with 18 different concept types (e.g. Disorders, Substances, Findings and Procedures).",

    "Large language model (ChatGPT) as a support tool for breast tumor board": "Large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT have gained public and scientific attention. The aim of this study is to evaluate ChatGPT as a support tool for breast tumor board decisions making. We inserted into ChatGPT - 3.5 clinical information of ten consecutive patients presented in a breast tumor board in our institution. We asked the chatbot to recommend management. The results generated by ChatGPT were compared to the final recommendations of the tumor board. They were also graded independently by two senior radiologists. Grading scores were between 1 \u2013 5 (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree), and in three different categories: summarization, recommendation, and explanation. The mean age was 49.4, 8/10 (80%) of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, one patient (1/10, 10%) had a ductal carcinoma in - situ and one patient (1/10, 10%) had a phyllodes tumor with atypia. In seven out of ten cases (70%), ChatGPT\u2019s recommendations were similar to the tumor board\u2019s decisions. Mean scores while grading the chatbot\u2019s summarization, recommendation and explanation by the first reviewer were 3.7, 4.3, and 4.6 respectively. Mean values for the second reviewer were 4.3, 4.0, and 4.3, respectively. In this proof - of - concept study, we present initial results on the use of an LLM as a decision support tool in a breast tumor board. Given the significant advancements, it is warranted for clinicians to be familiar with the potential benefits and harms of the technology.",

    "Temporal Data Meets LLM - Explainable Financial Time Series Forecasting": "This paper presents a novel study on harnessing Large Language Models\u2019(LLMs) outstanding knowledge and reasoning abilities for explainable \ufb01nancial time series forecasting. The application of machine learning models to \ufb01nancial time series comes with several challenges, including the di\ufb03culty in cross - sequence reasoning and inference, the hurdle of incorporating multi - modal signals from historical news, \ufb01nancial knowledge graphs, etc., and the issue of interpreting and explaining the model results. In this paper, we focus on NASDAQ - 100 stocks, making use of publicly accessible historical stock price data, company metadata, and historical economic/\ufb01nancial news. We conduct experiments to illustrate the potential of LLMs in o\ufb00ering a uni\ufb01ed solution to the aforementioned challenges. Our experiments include trying zero - shot/few - shot inference with GPT - 4 and instruction - based \ufb01ne - tuning with a public LLM model Open LLaMA. We demonstrate our approach outperforms a few baselines, including the widely applied classic ARMA - GARCH model and a gradient - boosting tree model. Through the performance comparison results and a few examples, we \ufb01nd LLMs can make a well - thought decision by reasoning over information from both textual news and price time series and extracting insights, leveraging cross - sequence information, and utilizing the inherent knowledge embedded within the LLM. Additionally, we show that a publicly available LLM such as Open - LLaMA, after \ufb01ne - tuning, can comprehend the instruction to generate explainable forecasts and achieve reasonable performance, albeit relatively inferior in comparison to GPT - 4.",

    "Graph-to-Tree Learning for Solving Math Word Problems": "While the recent tree-based neural models have demonstrated promising results in generating solution expression for the math word problem (MWP), most of these models do not capture the relationships and order information among the quantities well. This results in poor quantity representations and incorrect solution expressions. In this paper, we propose Graph2Tree, a novel deep learning architecture that combines the merits of the graph-based encoder and tree-based decoder to generate better solution expressions. Included in our Graph2Tree framework are two graphs, namely the Quantity Cell Graph and Quantity Comparison Graph, which are designed to address limitations of existing methods by effectively representing the relationships and order information among the quantities in MWPs. We conduct extensive experiments on two available datasets. Our experiment results show that Graph2Tree outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmark datasets significantly. We also discuss case studies and empirically examine Graph2Tree\u2019s effectiveness in translating the MWP text into solution expressions1.",
    "What Is the Impact of ChatGPT on Education? A Rapid Review of the Literature": "An arti\ufb01cial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the \ufb01rst three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023).
