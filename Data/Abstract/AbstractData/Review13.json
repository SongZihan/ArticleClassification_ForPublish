    "Exploring New Frontiers in Agricultural NLP: Investigating the Potential of Large Language Models for Food Applications": "This paper explores new frontiers in agricultural natural language processing by investigating the effectiveness of using food-related text corpora for pretraining transformer-based language models. In particular, we focus on the task of semantic matching, which involves establishing mappings between food descriptions and nutrition data. To accomplish this, we fine-tune a pre-trained transformer-based language model, AgriBERT, on this task, utilizing an external source of knowledge, such as the FoodOn ontology. To advance the field of agricultural NLP , we propose two new avenues of exploration: (1) utilizing GPT -based models as a baseline and (2) leveraging ChatGPT as an external source of knowledge. ChatGPT has shown to be a strong baseline in many NLP tasks, and we believe it has the potential to improve our model in the task of semantic matching and enhance our model\u2019s understanding of food-related concepts and relationships. Additionally, we experiment with other applications, such as cuisine prediction based on food ingredients, and expand the scope of our research to include other NLP tasks beyond semantic matching. Overall, this paper provides promising avenues for future research in this field, with potential implications for improving the performance of agricultural NLP applications.",
    "Large Language Models and Foundation Models in Smart Agriculture: Basics, Opportunities, and Challenges": "The past decade has witnessed the rapid development and adoption of machine and deep learning (ML & DL) methodologies in agricultural systems, showcased by great successes in applications such as smart crop management, smart plant breeding, smart livestock farming, precision aquaculture farming, and agricultural robotics. However, these conventional ML/DL models have certain limitations: they heavily rely on large, costly - to - acquire labeled datasets for training, require specialized expertise for development and maintenance, and are mostly tailored for specific tasks, thus lacking generalizability. Recently, large pre - trained models, also known as foundation models (FMs), have demonstrated remarkable successes in language, vision, and decision - making tasks across various domains. These models are trained on a vast amount of data from multiple domains and modalities. Once trained, they can accomplish versatile tasks with just minor fine - tuning and minimal task - specific labeled data. Despite their proven effectiveness and huge potential, there has been little exploration of applying FMs to agriculture artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential of FMs in the field of smart agriculture. In particular, conceptual tools and technical background are presented to facilitate the understanding of the problem space and uncover new research directions in this field. To this end, recent FMs in the general computer science (CS) domain are reviewed, and the models are",

    "Large Language Models Are State-of-the-Art Evaluators of Translation Quality": "We describe GEMBA, a GPT-based metric for assessment of translation quality, which works both with a reference translation and without. In our evaluation, we focus on zero-shot prompting, comparing four prompt variants in two modes, based on the availability of the reference. We investigate nine versions of GPT models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4. We show that our method for translation quality assessment only works with GPT 3.5 and larger models. Comparing to results from WMT22\u2019s Metrics shared task, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both modes when compared to MQM-based human labels. Our results are valid on the system level for all three WMT22 Metrics shared task language pairs, namely English into German, English into Russian, and Chinese into English. This provides a first glimpse into the usefulness of pre-trained, generative large language models for quality assessment of translations. We publicly release all our code and prompt templates used for the experiments described in this work, as well as all corresponding scoring results, to allow for external validation and reproducibility.",

One of the most remarkable applications is creative writing, e.g., poetry or storytelling: the generated outputs are often of astonishing quality. However, a natural question arises: can LLMs be really considered creative? In this article, we first analyze the development of LLMs under the lens of creativity theories, investi- gating the key open questions and challenges. In particular, we focus our discussion on the dimensions of value, novelty, and surprise as proposed by Margaret Boden in her work. Then, we consider different classic perspectives, namely product, process, press, and person. We discuss a set of \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201chard\u201d problems in machine cre- ativity, presenting them in relation to LLMs. Finally, we examine the societal impact of these technologies with a particular focus on the creative industries, analyzing the opportunities offered, the challenges arising from them, and the potential associated risks, from both legal and ethical points of view.",
    "Art or Artifice? Large Language Models and the False Promise of Creativity": "Researchers have argued that large language models (LLMs) exhibit high-quality writing capabilities from blogs to stories. However, evaluating objectively the creativity of a piece of writing is challenging. Inspired by the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) [64], which measures creativity as a process , we use the Consensual Assessment Technique [ 3] and propose Torrance Test of Creative Writing (TTCW) to evaluate creativity as product . TTCW consists of 14 binary tests organized into the original dimensions of Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. We recruit 10 creative writers and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by professional authors or LLMs using TTCW. Our analysis shows that LLM-generated stories pass 3-10X less TTCW tests than stories written by professionals. In addition, we explore the use of LLMs as assessors to automate the TTCW evaluation, revealing that none of the LLMs positively correlate with the expert assessments.",
    "LLM as an Art Director (LaDi): Using LLM\u2019s to improve Text-to-Media Generators": "Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have revo lutionized numerous \ufb01elds, including art and cinema, by automating the generati on of high-quality, context-aware images and video.

    "Artificial intelligence and the copyright dilemma": "Authorship of copyrightable works has been a hotly contested issue in the American legal system for over 200 years.  With the recent boom of artificial intelligence, more and more creative works have been the result of non - human authors.  Computer algorithms and learning machines have become a new source of creativity.  The U.S. Copyright Office, however, has been slow to acknowledge the significance of AI in the creative process by denying copyrights of non - human works and releasing them into the public domain.  This paper addresses the issue of IP ownership of AI generated works.  It argues that giving authorship to AI programmers and owners is essential to the future development of the AI industry.  The paper proposes that instead of redefining \u201cauthorship\u201d to include non - humans, it is simply necessary to reinterpret the terms \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cemployer\u201d in the made for hire doctrine of the U.S. Copyright Act.  This reinterpretation would allow the current IP system to continue promoting \u201cthe progress of science and useful arts\u201d without a lengthy or controversial overhaul of the rules and guidelines currently set in place.",

    "Large Language Model in Creative Work: The Role of Collaboration Modality and User Expertise": "Since the launch of ChatGPT in Dec 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly adopted by businesses to assist users in a wide range of open-ended tasks, including creative work. While the versatility of LLM has unlocked new ways of human-AI collaboration, it remains uncertain how LLMs should be used to enhance business outcomes. To examine the effects of human-LLM collaboration on business outcomes, we conducted an experiment where we tasked expert and non-expert users to write an ad copy with and without the assistance of LLMs. Here, we investigate and compare two ways of working with LLMs: (1) using LLMs as \u201cghostwriters,\u201d which assume the main role of content generation task and (2) using LLMs as \u201csounding boards,\u201d to provide feedback on human-created content. We measure the quality of the ads using the number of clicks generated by the created ads on major social media platforms. Our results show that different collaboration modalities can result in very different outcomes for different user types. Using LLMs as sounding boards enhances the quality of the resultant ad copies for non-experts. However, using LLMs as ghostwriters did not provide significant benefits and is in fact detrimental to expert users. We rely on textual analyses to understand the mechanisms and learned that using LLMs as ghostwriters produces an anchoring effect which leads to lower-quality ads. On the other hand, using LLMs as sounding boards helped non-experts achieve ad content with low semantic divergence to content produced by experts, thereby closing the gap between the two types of users."

    "How  well  can a large  language  model  explain  business  processes  as perceived  by users?": "Large Language  Models  (LLMs)  are trained  on a vast amount  of text to interpret  and generate human-like  textual  content.  They are becoming  a vital vehicle  in realizing  the vision of the autonomous  enterprise,  with organizations  today actively  adopting  LLMs to automate  many aspects  of their operations.  LLMs are likely to play a prominent  role in future AI-augmented business  process  management  systems  (ABPMSs)  catering  functionalities  across all system lifecycle  stages. One such system\u2019s  functionality  is Situation-Aware  eXplainability  (SAX), which relates to generating  causally  sound and yet human-interpretable  explanations  that take into account  the process  context  in which the explained  condition  occurred. In this paper, we present  the SAX4BPM  framework  developed  to generate  SAX explanations. The SAX4BPM  suite consists  of a set of services  and a central  knowledge  repository.  The functionality  of these services  is to elicit the various  knowledge  ingredients  that underlie SAX explanations.  A key innovative  component  among these ingredients  is the causal process execution  view. In this work, we integrate  the framework  with an LLM to leverage  its power to synthesize  the various  input ingredients  for the sake of improved  SAX explanations. Since the use of LLMs for SAX is also accompanied  by a certain  degree of doubt related to its capacity  to adequately  fulfill SAX along with its tendency  for hallucination  and lack of inherent  capacity  to reason,  we pursued  a methodological  evaluation  of the perceived  quality of the generated  explanations.  To this aim, we developed  a designated  scale and conducted a rigorous  user study. Our findings  show that the input presented  to the LLMs aided with the guard-railing  of its performance,  yielding  SAX explanations  having better-perceived  fidelity.  This improvement  is moderated  by the perception  of trust and curiosi",

To address these gaps, we introduce FinCoT, the first open high-fidelity CoT corpus for finance, distilled from seven QA datasets by a novel three-stage pipeline that incorporates domain supervision, iterative LLM refinement, and difficulty-aware filtering. Based on FinCoT, we develop Fin-o1, the first open financial reasoning models trained via supervised fine-tuning and GRPO-based RL. Our models outperform existing financial reasoning models and SOTA general models such as GPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.5. We also investigate the effectiveness of three different RL methods in improving domain-specific reasoning, offering the first such empirical study. We finally propose FinReason, the first financial reasoning benchmark covering multi-table analysis, long-context reasoning, and equation-based tasks, and evaluate 29 LLMs. Our extensive experiments reveal general reasoning models excel on standard benchmarks yet exhibit obvious performance degradation in financial contexts; even finance-tuned models like Dianjin-R1 and FinR1 degrade on lengthy documents.

It argues that his account of pragmatic law application can be improved as it does not fully consider that law application (and rule-following) is a shared, public practice collectively realized by members of a linguistic community. The study concludes that LLMs cannot apply the law. They cannot apply the law in the inferential sense as they have mere syntactic (not semantic) interaction with the law. They cannot apply the law in the pragmatic sense as pragmatic law application does not depend on a single agent, whether that agent is a judge, an ordinary citizen, or a non-human entity."

    "Investigating Bias in LLM-Based Bias Detection: Disparities between LLMs and Human Perception": "The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation in social media underscores the critical importance of detecting media bias. While robust Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as foundational tools for bias prediction, concerns about inherent biases within these models persist. In this work, we investigate the presence and nature of bias within LLMs and its consequential impact on media bias detection. Departing from conventional approaches that focus solely on bias detection in media content, we delve into biases within the LLM systems themselves. Through meticulous examination, we probe whether LLMs exhibit biases, particularly in political bias prediction and text continuation tasks. Additionally, we explore bias across diverse topics, aiming to uncover nuanced variations in bias expression within the LLM framework. Importantly, we propose debiasing strategies, including prompt engineering and model fine - tuning. Extensive analysis of bias tendencies across different LLMs sheds light on the broader landscape of bias propagation in language models. This study advances our understanding of LLM bias, offering critical insights into its implications for bias detection tasks and paving the way for more robust and equitable AI systems.",
    "MentaLLaMA: Interpretable Mental Health Analysis on Social Media with Large Language Models": "As an integral part of people\u2019s daily lives, social media is becoming a rich source for automatic mental health analysis. As traditional discriminative methods bear poor generalization ability and low interpretability, the recent large language models (LLMs) have been explored for interpretable mental health analysis on social media, which aims to provide detailed explanations along with predictions in zero-shot or few-shot settings. The results show that LLMs still achieve unsatisfactory classification performance in a zero-shot/few-shot manner, which further significantly affects the quality of the generated explanations. Domain-specific finetuning is an effective solution, but faces two critical challenges: 1) lack of high-quality training data. 2) no open-source foundation LLMs. To alleviate these problems, we formally model interpretable mental health analysis as a text generation task, and build the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental health instruction (IMHI) dataset with 105K data samples to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. The raw social media data are collected from 10 existing sources covering 8 mental health analysis tasks. We prompt ChatGPT with expert-designed few-shot prompts to obtain explanations. To ensure the reliability of the explanations, we perform strict automatic and human evaluations on the correctness, consistency, and quality of generated data. Based on the IMHI dataset and LLaMA2 foundation models, we train MentaLLaMA, the first open-source instruction-following LLM series for interpretable mental health analysis on social media. We evaluate MentaLLaMA and other advanced methods on the IMHI benchmark, the first holistic evaluation benchmark for interpretable mental health analysis. The results show that MentaLLaMA approaches state-of-the-art discrimi",
    "Simulating Social Media Using Large Language Models to Evaluate Alternative News Feed Algorithms": "Social media is often criticized for amplifying toxic discourse and discouraging constructive conversations. But designing social media platforms to promote better conversations is inherently challenging. This paper asks whether simulating social media through a combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Agent-Based Modeling can help researchers study how different news feed algorithms shape the quality of online conversations. We create realistic personas using data from the American National Election Study to populate simulated social media platforms. Next, we prompt the agents to read and share news articles \u2014 and like or comment upon each other\u2019s messages \u2014 within three platforms that use different news feed algorithms. In the first platform, users see the most liked and commented posts from users whom they follow. In the second, they see posts from all users \u2014 even those outside their own network. The third platform employs a novel \u201cbridging\u201d algorithm that highlights posts that are liked by people with opposing political views. We find this bridging algorithm promotes more constructive, non-toxic, conversation across political divides than the other two models. Though further research is needed to evaluate these findings, we argue that LLMs hold considerable potential to improve simulation research on social media and many other complex social settings.",
    "\u201cI\u2019m Not Sure, But...\u201d: Examining the Impact of Large Language Models\u2019 Uncertainty Expression on User Reliance and Trust": "Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs\u2019 expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants\u2019 reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., \u201c I\u2019m not sure, but... \u201d) decrease participants\u2019 confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system\u2019s answers, while increasing participants\u2019 accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., \u201c It\u2019s not clear, but... \u201d), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.",
    "Challenges and Innovations in LLM-Powered Fake News Detection: A Synthesis of Approaches and Future Directions": "The pervasiveness of the dissemination of fake news through social media platforms poses critical risks to the trust of the general public, societal stability, and democratic institutions. This challenge calls for novel methodologies in detection, which can keep pace with the dynamic and multi-modal nature of misinformation. Recent works include powering the detection using large language model advances in multimodal frameworks, methodologies using graphs, and adversarial training in the literature of fake news. Based on the different approaches which can bring success, some key highlights will be underlined: enhanced LLM-improves accuracy through more advanced semantics and cross-modality fusion for robust detections. The review further identifies critical gaps in adaptability to dynamic social media trends, real-time, and cross-platform detection capabilities, as well as the ethical challenges thrown up by the misuse of LLMs. Future directions underline the development of style-agnostic models, cross-lingual detection frameworks, and robust policies with a view to mitigating LLM-driven misinformation. This synthesis thus lays a concrete foundation for those researchers and practitioners committed to reinforcing fake news detection systems with complications that keep on growing in the digital landscape.",

The studies mentioned here also explore the impact of LLMs in shaping social media communications, addressing technological advancements, and attendant social responsibilities.",
    "Large language models can infer psychological dispositions of social media users": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly human-like abilities across a wide variety of tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs like ChatGPT can accurately infer the psychological dispositions of social media users and whether their ability to do so varies across socio-demographic groups. Specifically, we test whether GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can derive the Big Five personality traits from users\u2019 Facebook status updates in a zero-shot learning scenario. Our results show an average correlation of r=0B29 (range =[0B22, 0B33]) between LLM-inferred and self-reported trait scores \u2014a level of accuracy that is similar to that of supervised machine learning models specifically trained to infer personality. Our findings also highlight heterogeneity in the accuracy of personality inferences across different age groups and gender categories: predictions were found to be more accurate for women and younger individuals on several traits, suggesting a potential bias stemming from the underlying training data or differences in online self-expression. The ability of LLMs to infer psychological dispositions from user-generated text has the potential to democratize access to cheap and scalable psychometric assessments for both researchers and practitioners. On the one hand, this democratization might facilitate large-scale research of high ecological validity and spark innovation in personalized services. On the other hand, it also raises ethical concerns regarding user privacy and self-determination, highlighting the need for stringent ethical frameworks and regulation.",
    "Large Language Models Outperform Expert Coders and Supervised Classifiers at Annotating Political Social Media Messages": "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful new tool for text analysis. As these models are capable of zero-shot annotation based on instructions written in natural language, they obviate the need of large sets of training data \u2014and thus bring potential paradigm-shifting implications for using text as data. While the models show substantial promise, their relative performance compared to human coders and supervised models remains poorly understood and subject to significant academic debate. This paper assesses the strengths and weaknesses of popular fine-tuned AI models compared to both conventional supervised classifiers and manual annotation by experts and crowd workers. The task used is to identify the political affiliation of politicians based on a single X/Twitter message, focusing on data from 11 different countries. The paper finds that GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy than both supervised models and human coders across all languages and country contexts. In the US context, it achieves an accuracy of 0.934 and an inter-coder reliability of 0.982. Examining the cases where the models fail, the paper finds that the LLM \u2014unlike the supervised models \u2014correctly annotates messages that require interpretation of implicit or unspoken references, or reasoning on the basis of contextual knowledge \u2014capacities that have traditionally been understood to be distinctly human. The paper thus contributes to our understanding of the revolutionary implications of LLMs for text analysis within the social sciences."

    "Large language models in health care: Development, applications, and challenges": "Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, has attracted significant attention due to its exceptional language comprehension and content generation capabilities, highlighting the immense potential of large language models (LLMs). LLMs have become a burgeoning hotspot across many fields, including health care. Within health care, LLMs may be classified into LLMs for the biomedical domain and LLMs for the clinical domain based on the corpora used for pre - training. In the last 3 years, these domain - specific LLMs have demonstrated exceptional performance on multiple natural language processing tasks, surpassing the performance of general LLMs as well. This not only emphasizes the significance of developing dedicated LLMs for the specific domains, but also raises expectations for their applications in health care. We believe that LLMs may be used widely in preconsultation, diagnosis, and management, with appropriate development and supervision. Additionally, LLMs hold tremendous promise in assisting with medical education, medical writing and other related applications. Likewise, health care systems must recognize and address the challenges posed by LLMs.",

    "Program Synthesis with Large Language Models": "This paper explores the limits of the current generation of large language models for program synthesis in general purpose programming languages. We evaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on two new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and \ufb01ne-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of these models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language descriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974programming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The MathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914 problems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more complex text. On both datasets, we \ufb01nd that synthesis performance scales log-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without \ufb01netuning on a code dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6% of the problems from MBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a held-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage points across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest \ufb01ne-tuned model achieves 83.8% accuracy. Going further, we study the model\u2019s ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to improve its solutions. We \ufb01nd that natural language feedback from a human halves the error rate compared to the model\u2019s initial prediction. Additionally, we conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and what types of programs are most dif\ufb01cult to generate. Finally, we explore the semantic grounding of these models by \ufb01ne-tuning them to predict the results of program execution. We \ufb01nd that even our best models are generally unable to predict the output of a program given a speci\ufb01c input.",
    "A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS OF CODE": "Large language models (LMs) of code have recently shown tremendous promise in completing code and synthesizing code from natural language descriptions. However, the current state-of-the-art code LMs (e.g., Codex (Chen et al., 2021)) are not publicly available, leaving many questions about their model and data design decisions. We aim to \ufb01ll in some of these blanks through a systematic evaluation of the largest existing models: Codex, GPT - J, GPT - Neo, GPT - NeoX - 20B, and CodeParrot, across various programming languages. Although Codex itself is not open - source, we \ufb01nd that existing open - source models do achieve close results in some programming languages, although targeted mainly for natural language modeling. We further identify an important missing piece in the form of a large open - source model trained exclusively on a multi - lingual corpus of code. We release a new model, PolyCoder, with 2.7B parameters based on the GPT - 2 architecture, that was trained on 249GB of code across 12 programming languages on a single machine. In the C programming language, PolyCoder outperforms all models including Codex . Our trained models are open - source and publicly available at https://github.com/VHellendoorn/Code - LMs , which enables future research and application in this area.",
    "Fully Autonomous Programming with Large Language Models": "Current approaches to program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a \u201cnear miss syndrome\u201d: they tend to generate programs that semantically resemble the correct answer (as measured by text similarity metrics or human evaluation), but achieve a low or even zero accuracy as measured by unit tests due to small imperfections, such as the wrong input or output format. This calls for an approach known as Synthesize, Execute, Debug (SED), whereby a draft of the solution is generated first, followed by a program repair phase addressing the failed tests. To effectively apply this approach to instruction-driven LLMs, one needs to determine which prompts perform best as instructions for LLMs, as well as strike a balance between repairing unsuccessful programs and replacing them with newly generated ones. We explore these trade - offs empirically, comparing replace - focused, repair - focused, and hybrid debug strategies, as well as different template - based and model - based prompt - generation techniques. We use OpenAI Codex as the LLM and Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 as a database of problem descriptions and tests for evaluation. The resulting framework outperforms both conventional usage of Codex without the repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches.",
    "Can Large Language Models Transform Computational Social Science?": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the Computational Social Science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers\u2019 gold references. We conclude that the performance of today\u2019s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans.",
    "The Larger They Are, the Harder They Fail: Language Models do not Recognize Identifier Swaps in Python": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have successfully been applied to code generation tasks, raising the question of how well these models understand programming. Typical programming languages have invariances and equivariances in their semantics that human programmers intuitively understand and exploit, such as the (near) invariance to the renaming of identifiers. We show that LLMs not only fail to properly generate correct Python code when default function names are swapped, but some of them even become more confident in their incorrect predictions as the model size increases, an instance of the recently discovered phenomenon of Inverse Scaling, which runs contrary to the commonly observed trend of increasing prediction quality with increasing model size. Our findings indicate that, despite their astonishing typical - case performance, LLMs still lack a deep, abstract understanding of the content they manipulate, making them unsuitable for tasks that statistically deviate from their training data, and that mere scaling is not enough to achieve such capability.",

    "Using Large Language Models to Enhance Programming Error Messages": "A key part of learning to program is learning to understand programming error messages. They can be hard to interpret and identifying the cause of errors can be time-consuming. One factor in this challenge is that the messages are typically intended for an audience that already knows how to program, or even for programming environments that then use the information to highlight areas in code. Researchers have been working on making these errors more novice friendly since the 1960s, however progress has been slow. The present work contributes to this stream of research by using large language models to enhance programming error messages with explanations of the errors and suggestions on how to fix them. Large language models can be used to create useful and novice-friendly enhancements to programming error messages that sometimes surpass the original programming error messages in interpretability and actionability. These results provide further evidence of the benefits of large language models for computing educators, highlighting their use in areas known to be challenging for students.

    "Moderating Illicit Online Image Promotion for Unsafe User-Generated Content Games Using Large Vision-Language Models": "Online user-generated content games (UGCGs) are increasingly popular among children and adolescents for social interaction and more creative online entertainment. However, they pose a heightened risk of exposure to explicit content, raising growing concerns for the online safety of children and adolescents. Despite these concerns, few studies have addressed the issue of illicit image-based promotions of unsafe UGCGs on social media, which can inadvertently attract young users. This challenge arises from the difficulty of obtaining comprehensive training data for UGCG images and the unique nature of these images, which differ from traditional unsafe content. In this work, we take the first step towards studying the threat of illicit promotions of unsafe UGCGs. We collect a real-world dataset comprising 2,924 images that display diverse sexually explicit and violent content used to promote UGCGs by their game creators. Our in-depth studies reveal a new understanding of this problem and the urgent need for automatically flagging illicit UGCG promotions. We additionally create a cutting-edge system, UGCG-GUARD, designed to aid social media platforms in effectively identifying images used for illicit UGCG promotions. This system leverages recently introduced large vision-language models (VLMs) and employs a novel conditional prompting strategy for zero-shot domain adaptation, along with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for contextual identification. UGCG-GUARD achieves outstanding results, with an accuracy rate of 94% in detecting these images used for the illicit promotion of such games in real-world scenarios.",
    "A Comprehensive Survey of Scientific Large Language Models and Their Applications in Scientific Discovery": "In many scientific fields, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way text and other modalities of data ( e.g., molecules and proteins) are handled, achieving superior performance in various applications and augmenting the scientific discovery process. Nevertheless, previous surveys on scientific LLMs often concentrate on one or two fields or a single modality. In this paper, we aim to provide a more holistic view of the research landscape by unveiling cross-field and cross-modal connections between scientific LLMs regarding their architectures and pre-training techniques. To this end, we comprehensively survey over 260 scientific LLMs, discuss their commonalities and differences, as well as summarize pre-training datasets and evaluation tasks for each field and modality. Moreover, we investigate how LLMs have been deployed to benefit scientific discovery. Resources related to this survey are available at https://github.com/yuzhimanhua/Awesome-Scientific-Language-Models .",
    "LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL INFERENCE ACCELERATION : A COMPREHENSIVE HARDWARE PERSPECTIVE": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various fields, from natural language understanding to text generation. Compared to non-generative LLMs like BERT and DeBERTa, generative LLMs like GPT series and Llama series are currently the main focus due to their superior algorithmic performance. The advancements in generative LLMs are closely intertwined with the development of hardware capabilities. Various hardware platforms exhibit distinct hardware characteristics, which can help improve LLM inference performance. Therefore, this paper comprehensively surveys efficient generative LLM inference on different hardware platforms. First, we provide an overview of the algorithm architecture of mainstream generative LLMs and delve into the inference process. Then, we summarize different optimization methods for different platforms such as CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC, and PIM/NDP, and provide inference results for generative LLMs. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of inference performance with batch sizes 1 and 8 on different hardware platforms by considering hardware power consumption, absolute inference speed ( tokens/s ), and energy efficiency (tokens/J ). We compare the performance of the same optimization methods across different hardware platforms, the performance across different hardware platforms, and the performance of different methods on the same hardware platform. This provides a systematic and comprehensive summary of existing inference acceleration work by integrating software optimization methods and hardware platforms. We point out that the development of edge intelligence has gained significant momentum, driven by the increasing capability of LLMs and the increasing demands of edge applications. And three trends (multimodality, inference-time compute, and higher inference energy"

    "Customized language models for tourism management: Implications and future research": "Sitting at the intersection between social and computer sciences, human-computer interaction research focuses on understanding human behavior in relation to computer systems (Olson & Olson, 2002). Having seen many developments over the years, humancomputer interaction has been a focal point in sector-specific research, including in tourism management (Stankov & Gretzel, 2020; Tung & Law, 2020). Recently, attention has been given to human-artificial intelligence interaction in particular. For instance, Lu et al.'s (2019) Service Robot Integration Willingness Scale and Gursoy et al.'s (2019) Artificially Intelligent (AI) Device Use Acceptance model explore guests' willingness to accept different types of AI in tourism contexts, while Fu et al. (2022) have put forward the Robot Usage Resistance model to explain tourism employees' reasons for resisting the use of robots. Most recently, user interfaces based on large language models have rapidly grown in popularity (Shanahan et al., 2023). Language model based consumer products, such as ChatGPT or Gemini, offer tourism companies new ways of working (Tuomi, 2023). For instance, Expedia recently launched language model based trip-planning tools (Biesiada, 2023), InterContinental Hotels Group is building a similar tool to improve booking experience (IHG, 2024), while Air Canada made headlines when their language model offered tourists discounts that did not exist (Garcia, 2024). Importantly, the potential for so called ‘generative artificial intelligence’ goes beyond major tourism corporations or tourist-artificial intelligence interaction. New tools facilitate the construction and sharing of Custom Assistants – customized versions of popular large language models – at a click of a few buttons, providing new affordances for tourism businesses and other stakeholders by facilitating new types of human-computer interaction in tourism, including touristartificial intelligence, employee-artificial intelligence, business-artificial intelligence and policymaker-artificial intelligence.",
    "ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS : GUIDING RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT": "This paper examines the ethical considerations and implications of large language models (LLMs) in generating content. It highlights the potential for both positive and negative uses of generative AI programs and explores the challenges in assigning responsibility for their outputs. The discussion emphasizes the need for proactive ethical frameworks and policy measures to guide the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.",
    "TourLLM: Enhancing LLMs with Tourism Knowledge": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the lack of tourism knowledge limits the performance of LLMs in tourist attraction presentations and travel planning. To address this challenge, we constructed a supervised fine-tuning dataset for the culture and tourism domain, named Cultour. This dataset consists of three parts: tourism knowledge base QA data, travelogues data, and tourism diversity QA data. Additionally, we propose TourLLM, a Qwen-based model supervised fine-tuned with Cultour, to improve the quality of the information provided about attractions and travel planning. To evaluate the performance of TourLLM, we employed both automatic and human evaluation, and we proposed a human evaluation criterion named CRA (Consistency, Readability, Availability). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the responses generated by the TourLLM. Our proposed Cultour is accessible at https://github.com/mrweiqk/Cultour.",
    "A novel forecasting framework combining virtual samples and enhanced Transformer models for tourism demand forecasting": "Accurate tourism demand forecasting is hindered by limited historical data and complex spatiotemporal dependencies among tourist origins. A novel forecasting framework integrating virtual sample generation and a novel Transformer predictor addresses constraints arising from restricted data availability. A spatiotemporal GAN produces realistic virtual samples by dynamically modeling spatial correlations through a graph convolutional network, and an enhanced Transformer captures local patterns with causal convolutions and long - term dependencies with self - attention, eliminating autoregressive decoding. A joint training strategy refines virtual sample generation based on predictor feedback to maintain robust performance under data - scarce conditions. Experimental evaluations on real - world daily and monthly tourism demand datasets indicate a reduction in average MASE by 18.37% compared to conventional Transformer - based models, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy. The integration of adaptive spatiotemporal sample augmentation with a specialized Transformer can effectively address limited - data forecasting scenarios in tourism management.",
    "TraveLLaMA: Facilitating Multi-modal Large Language Models to Understand Urban Scenes and Provide Travel Assistance": "Tourism and travel planning increasingly rely on digital assistance, yet existing multimodal AI systems often lack specialized knowledge and contextual understanding of urban environments. We present TraveLLaMA , a specialized multimodal language model designed for urban scene understanding and travel assistance. Our work addresses the fundamental challenge of developing practical AI travel assistants through a novel large-scale dataset of 220k question-answer pairs. This comprehensive dataset uniquely combines 130k text QA pairs meticulously curated from authentic travel forums with GPT-enhanced responses, alongside 90k vision-language QA pairs specifically focused on map understanding and scene comprehension. Through extensive fine-tuning experiments on state-of-the-art vision-language models (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, Shikra), we demonstrate significant performance improvements ranging from 6.5%-9.4% in both pure text travel understanding and visual question answering tasks. Our model exhibits exceptional capabilities in providing contextual travel recommendations, interpreting map locations, and understanding place-specific imagery while offering practical information such as operating hours and visitor reviews. Comparative evaluations show TraveLLaMA significantly outperforms general-purpose models in travel-specific tasks, establishing a new benchmark for multi-modal travel assistance systems.",
    "A Survey on Privacy Risks and Protection in Large Language Models": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to diverse applications, their capabilities raise significant privacy concerns. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of privacy risks associated with LLMs and examines current solutions to mitigate these challenges. First, we analyze privacy leakage and attacks in LLMs, focusing on how these models unintentionally expose sensitive information through techniques such as model inversion, training data extraction, and membership inference. We investigate the mechanisms of privacy leakage, including the unauthorized extraction of training data and the potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Next, we review existing privacy protection against such risks, such as inference detection, federated learning, backdoor mitigation, and confidential computing, and assess their effectiveness in preventing privacy leakage. Furthermore, we highlight key practical challenges and propose future research directions to develop secure and privacy - preserving LLMs, emphasizing privacy risk assessment, secure knowledge transfer between models, and interdisciplinary frameworks for privacy governance. Ultimately, this survey aims to establish a roadmap for addressing escalating privacy challenges in the LLMs domain.",

    "The Future of Tourism: Examining the Potential Applications of Large Language Models": "Large language models such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) have recently gained attention for their impressive natural language processing capabilities. While their potential to revolutionize various industries is still being explored, the tourism industry stands to benefit significantly from their use. In this study, we conduct an early assessment of the impact potential of GPTs on the tourism industry using a mixed - methods approach. We first analyze the existing literature on the use of GPTs in the tourism industry and identify several potential applications such as personalized travel recommendations, language translation, and chatbots. We then collect data from various stakeholders in the tourism industry through surveys and interviews to understand their current practices and their willingness to adopt GPT - based solutions. Our results indicate that while there is a high level of awareness and interest in GPTs among tourism professionals, the adoption of these technologies is currently limited. The main barriers identified include a lack of technical expertise, concerns around data privacy and security, and the high cost of implementing GPT - based solutions. However, those who have adopted GPTs report significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency and improved customer satisfaction. To further explore the potential of GPTs in the tourism industry, we conduct a pilot study to develop a GPT - based travel recommendation system. The system uses GPT to generate personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences and feedback. Our evaluation of the system indicates that it performs well in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction, demonstrating the potential for GPTs to provide personalized and tailored experiences to travellers. Overall, our study provides an early look at the impact potential of GPTs on the tourism industry and identifies several avenues for future research. We recommend that tourism professionals and researchers collaborate to address the current barriers to adoption and explore the full range of applications for GPTs in the industry."
