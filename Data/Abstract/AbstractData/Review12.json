    "A survey of large language models": "Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.",
    "Harnessing the power of LLMs in practice: a survey on ChatGPT and beyond": "This article presents a comprehensive and practical guide for practitioners and end-users working with Large Language Models (LLMs) in their downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. We provide discussions and insights into the usage of LLMs from the perspectives of models, data, and downstream tasks. First, we offer an introduction and brief summary of current language models. Then, we discuss the influence of pre-training data, training data, and test data. Most importantly, we provide a detailed discussion about the use and non-use cases of large language models for various natural language processing tasks, such as knowledge-intensive tasks, traditional natural language understanding tasks, generation tasks, emergent abilities, and considerations for specific tasks. We present various use cases and non-use cases to illustrate the practical applications and limitations of LLMs in real-world scenarios. We also try to understand the importance of data and the specific challenges associated with each NLP task. Furthermore, we explore the impact of spurious biases on LLMs and delve into other essential considerations, such as efficiency, cost, and latency, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of deploying LLMs in practice. This comprehensive guide aims to provide researchers and practitioners with valuable insights and best practices for working with LLMs, thereby enabling the successful implementation of these models in a wide range of NLP tasks. A curated list of practical guide resources of LLMs, regularly updated, can be found at https://github.com/Mooler0410/LLMsPracticalGuide.

    "PaLM: scaling language modeling with pathways": "Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.",
    "LLaMA: open and efficient foundation language models": "We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community.",
    "Llama 2: open foundation and fine-tuned chat models": "In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.",
    "Language models are few-shot learners": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.",
    "GPT-4 technical report": "We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.",
    "GLM: general language model pretraining with autoregressive blank infilling": "There have been various types of pretraining architectures including autoencoding models (e.g., BERT), autoregressive models (e.g., GPT), and encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5). However, none of the pretraining frameworks performs the best for all tasks of three main categories including natural language understanding (NLU), unconditional generation, and conditional generation. We propose a General Language Model (GLM) based on autoregressive blank infilling to address this challenge. GLM improves blank filling pretraining by adding 2D positional encodings and allowing an arbitrary order to predict spans, which results in performance gains over BERT and T5 on NLU tasks. Meanwhile, GLM can be pretrained for different types of tasks by varying the number and lengths of blanks. On a wide range of tasks across NLU, conditional and unconditional generation, GLM outperforms BERT, T5, and GPT given the same model sizes and data, and achieves the best performance from a single pretrained model with 1.25× parameters of BERT Large , demonstrating its generalizability to different downstream tasks.",
    "BERT: pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",
    "Attention is all you need": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",
    "Scaling laws for neural language models": "We study empirical scaling laws for language model performance on the cross-entropy loss. The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.",
    "An empirical analysis of compute-optimal large language model training": "We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4 more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperformsGopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, a 7% improvement over Gopher",
    "DeBERTa: decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention": "Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to predict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and pre-trained models will be made publicly available at this https URL.",
    "Language models are unsupervised multitask learners": "Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspecific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These findings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.",
    "Vicuna: an open-source chatbot impressing GPT-4 with 90% ChatGPT quality": "We introduce Vicuna-13B, an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LLaMA on user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT. Preliminary evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge shows Vicuna-13B achieves more than 90%* quality of OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Bard while outperforming other models like LLaMA and Stanford Alpaca in more than 90%* of cases. The cost of training Vicuna-13B is around $300. The code and weights, along with an online demo, are publicly available for non-commercial use.",
    "Mistral 7B": "We introduce Mistral 7B v0.1, a 7-billion-parameter language model engineered for superior performance and efficiency. Mistral 7B outperforms Llama 2 13B across all evaluated benchmarks, and Llama 1 34B in reasoning, mathematics, and code generation. Our model leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) for faster inference, coupled with sliding window attention (SWA) to effectively handle sequences of arbitrary length with a reduced inference cost. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mistral 7B -- Instruct, that surpasses the Llama 2 13B -- Chat model both on human and automated benchmarks. Our models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.",
    "Qwen technical report": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling natural language processing tasks that were previously thought to be exclusive to humans. In this work, we introduce Qwen, the first installment of our large language model series. Qwen is a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts. It includes Qwen, the base pretrained language models, and Qwen-Chat, the chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques. The base language models consistently demonstrate superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, and the chat models, particularly those trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are highly competitive. The chat models possess advanced tool-use and planning capabilities for creating agent applications, showcasing impressive performance even when compared to bigger models on complex tasks like utilizing a code interpreter. Furthermore, we have developed coding-specialized models, Code-Qwen and Code-Qwen-Chat, as well as mathematics-focused models, Math-Qwen-Chat, which are built upon base language models. These models demonstrate significantly improved performance in comparison with open-source models, and slightly fall behind the proprietary models.",
    "BART: denoising sequence-to-sequence pre-training for natural language generation, translation, and comprehension": "We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.",
    "UL2: unifying language learning paradigms": "Existing pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized&unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5&GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. By scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised finetuning based NLP tasks. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. On 0-shot MMLU, UL2 20B outperforms T0 and T5 models. UL2 20B also works well with chain-of-thought prompting and reasoning, making it an appealing choice for research into reasoning at a small to medium scale of 20B parameters. Finally, we apply FLAN instruction tuning to the UL2 20B model, achieving MMLU and Big-Bench scores competitive to FLAN-PaLM 62B. We release Flax-based T5X checkpoints for the UL2 20B&Flan-UL2 20B."

  "Development Methods of Medical Large Language Models": {
    "Large language models encode clinical knowledge": "Med-PaLM, a state-of-the-art large language model for medicine, is introduced and evaluated across several medical question answering tasks, demonstrating the promise of these models in this domain. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model^ 1 (PaLM, a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM^ 2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA^ 3 , MedMCQA^ 4 , PubMedQA^ 5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics^ 6 ), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.",
    "Toward expert-level medical question answering with large language models": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, with Med-PaLM being the first to exceed a ‘passing’ score in United States Medical Licensing Examination style questions. However, challenges remain in long-form medical question answering and handling real-world workflows. Here, we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps with a combination of base LLM improvements, medical domain fine-tuning and new strategies for improving reasoning and grounding through ensemble refinement and chain of retrieval. Med-PaLM 2 scores up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19%, and demonstrates dramatic performance increases across MedMCQA, PubMedQA and MMLU clinical topics datasets. Our detailed human evaluations framework shows that physicians prefer Med-PaLM 2 answers to those from other physicians on eight of nine clinical axes. Med-PaLM 2 also demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor across all evaluation metrics, particularly on new adversarial datasets designed to probe LLM limitations (P < 0.001). In a pilot study using real-world medical questions, specialists preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to generalist physician answers 65% of the time. While specialist answers were still preferred overall, both specialists and generalists rated Med-PaLM 2 to be as safe as physician answers, demonstrating its growing potential in real-world medical applications.",
    "Can generalist foundation models outcompete special-purpose tuning? Case study in medicine": "Generalist foundation models such as GPT-4 have displayed surprising capabilities in a wide variety of domains and tasks. Yet, there is a prevalent assumption that they cannot match specialist capabilities of fine-tuned models. For example, most explorations to date on medical competency benchmarks have leveraged domain-specific training, as exemplified by efforts on BioGPT and Med-PaLM. We build on a prior study of GPT-4's capabilities on medical challenge benchmarks in the absence of special training. Rather than using simple prompting to highlight the model's out-of-the-box capabilities, we perform a systematic exploration of prompt engineering. We find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks. The prompting methods we explore are general purpose, and make no specific use of domain expertise, removing the need for expert-curated content. Our experimental design carefully controls for overfitting during the prompt engineering process. We introduce Medprompt, based on a composition of several prompting strategies. With Medprompt, GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine of the benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. The method outperforms leading specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by a significant margin with an order of magnitude fewer calls to the model. Steering GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves a 27% reduction in error rate on the MedQA dataset over the best methods to date achieved with specialist models and surpasses a score of 90% for the first time. Beyond medical problems, we show the power of Medprompt to generalize to other domains and provide evidence for the broad applicability of the approach via studies of the strategy on exams in electrical engineering, machine learning, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology.",
    "PMC-LLaMA: toward building open-source language models for medicine": "OBJECTIVE\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding. While demonstrating proficiency in everyday conversations and question-answering (QA) situations, these models frequently struggle in domains that require precision, such as medical applications, due to their lack of domain-specific knowledge.

Methods We achieved this by adapting and refining the large language model meta-AI (LLaMA) using a large dataset of 100,000 patient-doctor dialogues sourced from a widely used online medical consultation platform. These conversations were cleaned and anonymized to respect privacy concerns. In addition to the model refinement, we incorporated a self-directed information retrieval mechanism, allowing the model to access and utilize real-time information from online sources like Wikipedia and data from curated offline medical databases.

    "MedAlpaca — an open-source collection of medical conversational AI models and training data": "As large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series continue to make strides, we witness the emergence of artificial intelligence applications in an ever-expanding range of fields. In medicine, these LLMs hold considerable promise for improving medical workflows, diagnostics, patient care, and education. Yet, there is an urgent need for open-source models that can be deployed on-premises to safeguard patient privacy. In our work, we present an innovative dataset consisting of over 160,000 entries, specifically crafted to fine-tune LLMs for effective medical applications. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning these datasets on publicly accessible pre-trained LLMs, and subsequently, we juxtapose the performance of pre-trained-only models against the fine-tuned models concerning the examinations that future medical doctors must pass to achieve certification.",

Nevertheless, LLMs have not yet performed optimally in biomedical domain tasks due to the need for medical expertise in the responses. In response to this challenge, we propose HuaTuo, a LLaMA-based model that has been supervised-fine-tuned with generated QA (Question-Answer) instances. The experimental results demonstrate that HuaTuo generates responses that possess more reliable medical knowledge.

    "Clinical Camel: an open-source expert-level medical language model with dialogue-based knowledge encoding": "Large Language Models (LLMs) present immense potential in the medical ﬁeld, yet concerns over data privacy, regulatory compliance, and model stability restrict their widespread adoption. Although the distillation of high-performing closed-source LLMs has proven effective for general tasks, their application in healthcare is limited due to reduced domain knowledge and remnants of alignment behavior hindering clinical tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Dialogue-Based Knowledge Encoding (DBKE). DBKE enhances models’ implicit knowledge base and primes them for conversational recall, augmenting their conversational capabilities and enabling a soft alignment for subsequent use cases. By transforming dense academic source text into synthetic dialogue, DBKE broadens the model’s knowledge base and enables a soft alignment that guides downstream behaviours. We present Clinical Camel, an open-source, healthcare-focused conversational model, to showcase the effectiveness of DBKE. Clinical Camel outperforms GPT-3.5 on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 3 with scores of 53.2% and 58.2%, respectively, compared to GPT-3.5’s scores of 36.1% and 55.7%.

    "BioBERT: a pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining": "Abstract Motivation Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. Results We introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR improvement).

    "Domain-specific language model pretraining for biomedical natural language processing": "Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition. To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding & Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.",
    "BioGPT: generative pre-trained transformer for biomedical text generation and mining": "Pre-trained language models have attracted increasing attention in the biomedical domain, inspired by their great success in the general natural language domain. Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98%, 38.42% and 40.76% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.",
    "Qilin-Med: multi-stage knowledge injection advanced medical large language model": "Integrating large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds great potential but faces challenges. Pre-training LLMs from scratch for domains like medicine is resource-heavy and often unfeasible. On the other hand, sole reliance on Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) can result in overconfident predictions and may not tap into domain-specific insights. In response, we present a multi-stage training method combining Domain-specific Continued Pre-training (DCPT), SFT, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In addition, we publish a 3Gb Chinese Medicine (ChiMed) dataset, encompassing medical question answering, plain texts, knowledge graphs, and dialogues, segmented into three training stages. The medical LLM trained with our pipeline, Qilin-Med, shows substantial performance improvement. In the CPT and SFT phases, Qilin-Med achieved 38.4% and 40.0% accuracy on the CMExam test set, respectively. It outperformed the basemodel Baichuan-7B (accuracy: 33.5%), by 7.5%. In the DPO phase, it scored 16.66 in BLEU-1 and 27.44 in ROUGE-1 on the Huatuo-26M test set, bringing further improvement to the SFT phase (12.69 in BLEU-1 and 24.21 in ROUGE-1). Additionally, we have further enhanced the model's performance through the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Experiments demonstrate that Qilin-Med-RAG achieves an accuracy rate of 42.8% on CMExam. These results highlight the contribution of our novel training approach in building LLMs for medical applications.",
    "DoctorGLM: fine-tuning your Chinese doctor is not a herculean task": "The recent progress of large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and GPT-4, in comprehending and responding to human instructions has been remarkable. Nevertheless, these models typically perform better in English and have not been explicitly trained for the medical domain, resulting in suboptimal precision in diagnoses, drug recommendations, and other medical advice. Additionally, training and deploying a dialogue model is still believed to be impossible for hospitals, hindering the promotion of LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we have collected databases of medical dialogues in Chinese with ChatGPT's help and adopted several techniques to train an easy-deploy LLM. Remarkably, we were able to fine-tune the ChatGLM-6B on a single A100 80G in 13 hours, which means having a healthcare-purpose LLM can be very affordable. DoctorGLM is currently an early-stage engineering attempt and contain various mistakes. We are sharing it with the broader community to invite feedback and suggestions to improve its healthcare-focused capabilities: https://github.com/xionghonglin/DoctorGLM.",
    "Zhongjing: enhancing the Chinese medical capabilities of large language model through expert feedback and real-world multi-turn dialogue": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in understanding and responding to user intents. However, their performance lag behind general use cases in some expertise domains, such as Chinese medicine. Existing efforts to incorporate Chinese medicine into LLMs rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with single-turn and distilled dialogue data. These models lack the ability for doctor-like proactive inquiry and multi-turn comprehension and cannot align responses with experts' intentions. In this work, we introduce Zhongjing, the first Chinese medical LLaMA-based LLM that implements an entire training pipeline from continuous pre-training, SFT, to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Additionally, we construct a Chinese multi-turn medical dialogue dataset of 70,000 authentic doctor-patient dialogues, CMtMedQA, which significantly enhances the model's capability for complex dialogue and proactive inquiry initiation. We also define a refined annotation rule and evaluation criteria given the unique characteristics of the biomedical domain. Extensive experimental results show that Zhongjing outperforms baselines in various capacities and matches the performance of ChatGPT in some abilities, despite the 100x parameters. Ablation studies also demonstrate the contributions of each component: pre-training enhances medical knowledge, and RLHF further improves instruction-following ability and safety. Our code, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/SupritYoung/Zhongjing.",
    "Med-Flamingo: a multimodal medical few-shot learner": "Medicine, by its nature, is a multifaceted domain that requires the synthesis of information across various modalities. Medical generative vision-language models (VLMs) make a first step in this direction and promise many exciting clinical applications. However, existing models typically have to be fine-tuned on sizeable down-stream datasets, which poses a significant limitation as in many medical applications data is scarce, necessitating models that are capable of learning from few examples in real-time. Here we propose Med-Flamingo, a multimodal few-shot learner adapted to the medical domain. Based on OpenFlamingo-9B, we continue pre-training on paired and interleaved medical image-text data from publications and textbooks. Med-Flamingo unlocks few-shot generative medical visual question answering (VQA) abilities, which we evaluate on several datasets including a novel challenging open-ended VQA dataset of visual USMLE-style problems. Furthermore, we conduct the first human evaluation for generative medical VQA where physicians review the problems and blinded generations in an interactive app. Med-Flamingo improves performance in generative medical VQA by up to 20\\% in clinician's rating and firstly enables multimodal medical few-shot adaptations, such as rationale generation. We release our model, code, and evaluation app under https://github.com/snap-stanford/med-flamingo.",
    "LLaVA-Med: training a large language-and-vision assistant for biomedicine in one day": "Conversational generative AI has demonstrated remarkable promise for empowering biomedical practitioners, but current investigations focus on unimodal text. Multimodal conversational AI has seen rapid progress by leveraging billions of image-text pairs from the public web, but such general-domain vision-language models still lack sophistication in understanding and conversing about biomedical images. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient approach for training a vision-language conversational assistant that can answer open-ended research questions of biomedical images. The key idea is to leverage a large-scale, broad-coverage biomedical figure-caption dataset extracted from PubMed Central, use GPT-4 to self-instruct open-ended instruction-following data from the captions, and then fine-tune a large general-domain vision-language model using a novel curriculum learning method. Specifically, the model first learns to align biomedical vocabulary using the figure-caption pairs as is, then learns to master open-ended conversational semantics using GPT-4 generated instruction-following data, broadly mimicking how a layperson gradually acquires biomedical knowledge. This enables us to train a Large Language and Vision Assistant for BioMedicine (LLaVA-Med) in less than 15 hours (with eight A100s). LLaVA-Med exhibits excellent multimodal conversational capability and can follow open-ended instruction to assist with inquiries about a biomedical image. On three standard biomedical visual question answering datasets, LLaVA-Med outperforms previous supervised state-of-the-art on certain metrics. To facilitate biomedical multimodal research, we will release our instruction-following data and the LLaVA-Med model.",
    "Capabilities of Gemini models in medicine": "Excellence in a wide variety of medical applications poses considerable challenges for AI, requiring advanced reasoning, access to up-to-date medical knowledge and understanding of complex multimodal data. Gemini models, with strong general capabilities in multimodal and long-context reasoning, offer exciting possibilities in medicine. Building on these core strengths of Gemini, we introduce Med-Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models that are specialized in medicine with the ability to seamlessly use web search, and that can be efficiently tailored to novel modalities using custom encoders. We evaluate Med-Gemini on 14 medical benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on 10 of them, and surpass the GPT-4 model family on every benchmark where a direct comparison is viable, often by a wide margin. On the popular MedQA (USMLE) benchmark, our best-performing Med-Gemini model achieves SoTA performance of 91.1% accuracy, using a novel uncertainty-guided search strategy. On 7 multimodal benchmarks including NEJM Image Challenges and MMMU (health&medicine), Med-Gemini improves over GPT-4V by an average relative margin of 44.5%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-Gemini's long-context capabilities through SoTA performance on a needle-in-a-haystack retrieval task from long de-identified health records and medical video question answering, surpassing prior bespoke methods using only in-context learning. Finally, Med-Gemini's performance suggests real-world utility by surpassing human experts on tasks such as medical text summarization, alongside demonstrations of promising potential for multimodal medical dialogue, medical research and education. Taken together, our results offer compelling evidence for Med-Gemini's potential, although further rigorous evaluation will be crucial before real-world deployment in this safety-critical domain.",
    "MAIRA-1: a specialised large multimodal model for radiology report generation": "We present a radiology-specific multimodal model for the task for generating radiological reports from chest X-rays (CXRs). Our work builds on the idea that large language model(s) can be equipped with multimodal capabilities through alignment with pre-trained vision encoders. On natural images, this has been shown to allow multimodal models to gain image understanding and description capabilities. Our proposed model (MAIRA-1) leverages a CXR-specific image encoder in conjunction with a fine-tuned large language model based on Vicuna-7B, and text-based data augmentation, to produce reports with state-of-the-art quality. In particular, MAIRA-1 significantly improves on the radiologist-aligned RadCliQ metric and across all lexical metrics considered. Manual review of model outputs demonstrates promising fluency and accuracy of generated reports while uncovering failure modes not captured by existing evaluation practices. More information and resources can be found on the project website: https://aka.ms/maira.",
    "Towards generalist foundation model for radiology": "In this study, we aim to initiate the development of Radiology Foundation Model, termed as RadFM. We consider the construction of foundational models from three perspectives, namely, dataset construction, model design, and thorough evaluation. Our contribution can be concluded as follows: (i), we construct a large-scale Medical Multi-modal Dataset, MedMD, which consists of 16M 2D and 3D medical scans with high-quality text descriptions or reports across various data formats, modalities, and tasks, covering over 5000 distinct diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, high-quality, medical visual-language dataset, with both 2D and 3D scans; (ii), we propose an architecture that enables visually conditioned generative pre-training, i.e., allowing for integration of text input with 2D or 3D medical scans, and generate responses for diverse radiologic tasks. The model was initially pre-trained on MedMD and subsequently fine-tuned on the domain-specific dataset, which is a radiologic cleaned version of MedMD, containing 3M radiologic visual-language pairs, termed as RadMD; (iii), we propose a new evaluation benchmark, RadBench, that comprises five tasks, including modality recognition, disease diagnosis, visual question answering, report generation and rationale diagnosis, aiming to comprehensively assess the capability of foundation models in handling practical clinical problems. We conduct both automatic and human evaluation on RadBench, in both cases, RadFM outperforms existing multi-modal foundation models, that are publicaly accessible, including Openflamingo, MedFlamingo, MedVInT and GPT-4V. Additionally, we also adapt RadFM for different public benchmarks, surpassing existing SOTAs on diverse datasets. All codes, data, and model checkpoint will all be made publicly available to promote further research and development in the field.",
    "AlpaCare: instruction-tuned large language models for medical application": "Instruction-finetuning (IFT) has become crucial in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human needs and has shown great potential in medical applications. However, previous studies mainly fine-tune LLMs on biomedical datasets with limited diversity, which often rely on benchmarks or narrow task scopes, and hence significantly limit the effectiveness on their medical instruction-following ability and generalizability. To bridge this gap, we propose creating a diverse, machine-generated medical IFT dataset, MedInstruct-52k, using GPT-4 and ChatGPT with a high-quality expert-curated seed set. We then fine-tune LLaMA-series models on the dataset to develop AlpaCare. Despite using a smaller domain-specific dataset than previous medical LLMs, AlpaCare not only demonstrates superior performance on medical applications, with up to 38.1% absolute gain over best baselines in medical free-form instruction evaluations, but also achieves 6.7% absolute gains averaged over multiple general domain benchmarks. Human evaluation further shows that AlpaCare consistently outperforms best baselines in terms of both correctness and helpfulness. We offer public access to our data, model, and codebase in https://github.com/XZhang97666/AlpaCare.",
    "LoRA: low-rank adaptation of large language models": "An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.",
    "Prefix-tuning: optimizing continuous prompts for generation": "Fine-tuning is the de facto way of leveraging large pretrained language models for downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning modifies all the language model parameters and therefore necessitates storing a full copy for each task. In this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters frozen and instead optimizes a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors, which we call the prefix. Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting for language models, allowing subsequent tokens to attend to this prefix as if it were “virtual tokens”. We apply prefix-tuning to GPT-2 for table-to-text generation and to BART for summarization. We show that by learning only 0.1% of the parameters, prefix-tuning obtains comparable performance in the full data setting, outperforms fine-tuning in low-data settings, and extrapolates better to examples with topics that are unseen during training.",
    "P-Tuning: prompt tuning can be comparable to fine-tuning across scales and tasks": "Prompt tuning, which only tunes continuous prompts with a frozen language model, substantially reduces per-task storage and memory usage at training. However, in the context of NLU, prior work reveals that prompt tuning does not perform well for normal-sized pretrained models. We also find that existing methods of prompt tuning cannot handle hard sequence labeling tasks, indicating a lack of universality. We present a novel empirical finding that properly optimized prompt tuning can be universally effective across a wide range of model scales and NLU tasks. It matches the performance of finetuning while having only 0.1%-3% tuned parameters. Our method P-Tuning v2 is an implementation of Deep Prompt Tuning (CITATION) optimized and adapted for NLU. Given the universality and simplicity of P-Tuning v2, we believe it can serve as an alternative to finetuning and a strong baseline for future research.",
    "Parameter-efficient transfer learning for NLP": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is an effective transfer mechanism in NLP. However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100% of the parameters per task.",
    "Baize: an open-source chat model with parameter-efficient tuning on self-chat data": "Chat models, such as ChatGPT, have shown impressive capabilities and have been rapidly adopted across numerous domains. However, these models are only accessible through a restricted API, creating barriers for new research and progress in the field. We propose a pipeline that can automatically generate a high-quality multi-turn chat corpus by leveraging ChatGPT to engage in a conversation with itself. Subsequently, we employ parameter-efficient tuning to enhance LLaMA, an open-source large language model. The resulting model, named Baize, demonstrates good performance in multi-turn dialogues with guardrails that minimize potential risks. Additionally, we propose a new technique called Self-Distill with Feedback, to further improve the performance of the Baize models with feedback from ChatGPT.",
    "CPLLM: clinical prediction with large language models": "We present Clinical Prediction with Large Language Models (CPLLM), a method that involves fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for predicting clinical disease and readmission. We utilized quantization and fine-tuned the LLM using prompts. For diagnostic predictions, we predicted whether patients would be diagnosed with a target disease during their next visit or in the subsequent diagnosis, leveraging their historical medical records. We compared our results to various baselines, including Retain and Med-BERT, the latter of which is the current state-of-the-art model for disease prediction using temporal structured EHR data. In addition, we also evaluated CPLLM’s utility in predicting hospital readmission and compared our method’s performance with benchmark baselines. Our experiments ultimately revealed that our proposed method, CPLLM, surpasses all the tested models in terms of PR-AUC and ROC-AUC metrics, providing state-of-the-art performance as a tool for predicting disease diagnosis and patient hospital readmission without requiring pre-training on medical data. Such a method can be easily implemented and integrated into the clinical workflow to help care providers plan next steps for their patients.",
    "SciBERT: a pretrained language model for scientific text": "Obtaining large-scale annotated data for NLP tasks in the scientific domain is challenging and expensive. We release SciBERT, a pretrained language model based on BERT (Devlin et. al., 2018) to address the lack of high-quality, large-scale labeled scientific data. SciBERT leverages unsupervised pretraining on a large multi-domain corpus of scientific publications to improve performance on downstream scientific NLP tasks. We evaluate on a suite of tasks including sequence tagging, sentence classification and dependency parsing, with datasets from a variety of scientific domains. We demonstrate statistically significant improvements over BERT and achieve new state-of-the-art results on several of these tasks. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/allenai/scibert/.",
    "Large biomedical question answering models with ALBERT and ELECTRA": "The majority of systems that participated in the BioASQ8 challenge are based on BioBERT model [1]. We adopt a different approach in our participation in the BioASQ9B challenge by taking advantage of large biomedical language models that are built on ELECTRA [2] and ALBERT [3] architectures, including both BioM-ELECTRA and BioM-ALBERT [4]. Moreover, we examine the advantage of transferability [5] between BioASQ and other text classification tasks such as The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) [6]. Our results show that both BioM-ELECTRA and BioM-ALBERT significantly outperform the BioBERT model on the BioASQ9B task.",
    "Don’t stop pretraining: adapt language models to domains and tasks": "Language models pretrained on text from a wide variety of sources form the foundation of today’s NLP. In light of the success of these broad-coverage models, we investigate whether it is still helpful to tailor a pretrained model to the domain of a target task. We present a study across four domains (biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews) and eight classification tasks, showing that a second phase of pretraining in-domain (domain-adaptive pretraining) leads to performance gains, under both high- and low-resource settings. Moreover, adapting to the task’s unlabeled data (task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we consistently find that multi-phase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task performance.",
    "LinkBERT: pretraining language models with document links": "Language model (LM) pretraining captures various knowledge from text corpora, helping downstream tasks. However, existing methods such as BERT model a single document, and do not capture dependencies or knowledge that span across documents. In this work, we propose LinkBERT, an LM pretraining method that leverages links between documents, e.g., hyperlinks. Given a text corpus, we view it as a graph of documents and create LM inputs by placing linked documents in the same context. We then pretrain the LM with two joint self-supervised objectives: masked language modeling and our new proposal, document relation prediction. We show that LinkBERT outperforms BERT on various downstream tasks across two domains: the general domain (pretrained on Wikipedia with hyperlinks) and biomedical domain (pretrained on PubMed with citation links). LinkBERT is especially effective for multi-hop reasoning and few-shot QA (+5% absolute improvement on HotpotQA and TriviaQA), and our biomedical LinkBERT sets new states of the art on various BioNLP tasks (+7% on BioASQ and USMLE). We release our pretrained models, LinkBERT and BioLinkBERT, as well as code and data.",

The benchmark consists of five tasks with ten datasets that cover both biomedical and clinical texts with different dataset sizes and difficulties. We also evaluate several baselines based on BERT and ELMo and find that the BERT model pre-trained on PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III clinical notes achieves the best results. We make the datasets, pre-trained models, and codes publicly available at https://github.com/ ncbi-nlp/BLUE_Benchmark.",
    "SciFive: a text-to-text transformer model for biomedical literature": "In this report, we introduce SciFive, a domain-specific T5 model that has been pre-trained on large biomedical corpora. Our model outperforms the current SOTA methods (i.e. BERT, BioBERT, Base T5) on tasks in named entity relation, relation extraction, natural language inference, and question-answering. We show that text-generation methods have significant potential in a broad array of biomedical NLP tasks, particularly those requiring longer, more complex outputs. Our results support the exploration of more difficult text generation tasks and the development of new methods in this area",
    "ClinicalT5: a generative language model for clinical text": "In the past few years, large pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been widely adopted in different areas and have made fundamental improvements over a variety of downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Meanwhile, domain-specific variants of PLMs are being proposed to address the needs of domains that demonstrate a specific pattern of writing and vocabulary, e.g., BioBERT for the biomedical domain and ClinicalBERT for the clinical domain. Recently, generative language models like BART and T5 are gaining popularity with their competitive performance on text generation as well as on tasks cast as generative problems. However, in the clinical domain, such domain-specific generative variants are still underexplored. To address this need, our work introduces a T5-based text-to-text transformer model pre-trained on clinical text, i.e., ClinicalT5. We evaluate the proposed model both intrinsically and extrinsically over a diverse set of tasks across multiple datasets, and show that ClinicalT5 dramatically outperforms T5 in the domain-specific tasks and compares favorably with its close baselines.",
    "MedCPT: contrastive pre-trained transformers with large-scale PubMed search logs for zero-shot biomedical information retrieval": "MOTIVATION\nInformation retrieval (IR) is essential in biomedical knowledge acquisition and clinical decision support. While recent progress has shown that language model encoders perform better semantic retrieval, training such models requires abundant query-article annotations that are difficult to obtain in biomedicine. As a result, most biomedical IR systems only conduct lexical matching. In response, we introduce MedCPT, a first-of-its-kind Contrastively Pre-trained Transformer model for zero-shot semantic IR in biomedicine.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTo train MedCPT, we collected an unprecedented scale of 255 million user click logs from PubMed. With such data, we use contrastive learning to train a pair of closely integrated retriever and re-ranker. Experimental results show that MedCPT sets new state-of-the-art performance on six biomedical IR tasks, outperforming various baselines including much larger models, such as GPT-3-sized cpt-text-XL. In addition, MedCPT also generates better biomedical article and sentence representations for semantic evaluations. As such, MedCPT can be readily applied to various real-world biomedical IR tasks.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION\nThe MedCPT code and model are available at https://github.com/ncbi/MedCPT.",
    "Deep bidirectional language-knowledge graph pretraining": "Pretraining a language model (LM) on text has been shown to help various downstream NLP tasks. Recent works show that a knowledge graph (KG) can complement text data, offering structured background knowledge that provides a useful scaffold for reasoning. However, these works are not pretrained to learn a deep fusion of the two modalities at scale, limiting the potential to acquire fully joint representations of text and KG. Here we propose DRAGON (Deep Bidirectional Language-Knowledge Graph Pretraining), a self-supervised approach to pretraining a deeply joint language-knowledge foundation model from text and KG at scale. Specifically, our model takes pairs of text segments and relevant KG subgraphs as input and bidirectionally fuses information from both modalities. We pretrain this model by unifying two self-supervised reasoning tasks, masked language modeling and KG link prediction. DRAGON outperforms existing LM and LM+KG models on diverse downstream tasks including question answering across general and biomedical domains, with +5% absolute gain on average. In particular, DRAGON achieves notable performance on complex reasoning about language and knowledge (+10% on questions involving long contexts or multi-step reasoning) and low-resource QA (+8% on OBQA and RiddleSense), and new state-of-the-art results on various BioNLP tasks. Our code and trained models are available at https://github.com/michiyasunaga/dragon.",
    "BioMedLM: a domain-specific large language model for biomedical text": "Models such as GPT-4 and Med-PaLM 2 have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide variety of biomedical NLP tasks. However, these models have hundreds of billions of parameters, are computationally expensive to run, require users to send their input data over the internet, and are trained on unknown data sources. Can smaller, more targeted models compete? To address this question, we build and release BioMedLM, a 2.7 billion parameter GPT-style autoregressive model trained exclusively on PubMed abstracts and full articles. When fine-tuned, BioMedLM can produce strong multiple-choice biomedical question-answering results competitive with much larger models, such as achieving a score of 57.3% on MedMCQA (dev) and 69.0% on the MMLU Medical Genetics exam. BioMedLM can also be fine-tuned to produce useful answers to patient questions on medical topics. This demonstrates that smaller models can potentially serve as transparent, privacy-preserving, economical and environmentally friendly foundations for particular NLP applications, such as in biomedicine.

    "OphGLM: training an ophthalmology large language-and-vision assistant based on instructions and dialogue": "Large multimodal language models (LMMs) have achieved significant success in general domains. However, due to the significant differences between medical images and text and general web content, the performance of LMMs in medical scenarios is limited. In ophthalmology, clinical diagnosis relies on multiple modalities of medical images, but unfortunately, multimodal ophthalmic large language models have not been explored to date. In this paper, we study and construct an ophthalmic large multimodal model. Firstly, we use fundus images as an entry point to build a disease assessment and diagnosis pipeline to achieve common ophthalmic disease diagnosis and lesion segmentation. Then, we establish a new ophthalmic multimodal instruction-following and dialogue fine-tuning dataset based on disease-related knowledge data and publicly available real-world medical dialogue. We introduce visual ability into the large language model to complete the ophthalmic large language and vision assistant (OphGLM). Our experimental results demonstrate that the OphGLM model performs exceptionally well, and it has the potential to revolutionize clinical applications in ophthalmology.

    "BianQue: balancing the questioning and suggestion ability of health LLMs with multi-turn health conversations polished by ChatGPT": "Large language models (LLMs) have performed well in providing general and extensive health suggestions in single-turn conversations, exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT, ChatGLM, ChatDoctor, DoctorGLM, and etc. However, the limited information provided by users during single turn results in inadequate personalization and targeting of the generated suggestions, which requires users to independently select the useful part. It is mainly caused by the missing ability to engage in multi-turn questioning. In real-world medical consultations, doctors usually employ a series of iterative inquiries to comprehend the patient's condition thoroughly, enabling them to provide effective and personalized suggestions subsequently, which can be defined as chain of questioning (CoQ) for LLMs. To improve the CoQ of LLMs, we propose BianQue, a ChatGLM-based LLM finetuned with the self-constructed health conversation dataset BianQueCorpus that is consist of multiple turns of questioning and health suggestions polished by ChatGPT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BianQue can simultaneously balance the capabilities of both questioning and health suggestions, which will help promote the research and application of LLMs in the field of proactive health.",
    "ClinicalGPT: large language models finetuned with diverse medical data and comprehensive evaluation": "Large language models have exhibited exceptional performance on various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging techniques such as the pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning. Despite these advances, their effectiveness in medical applications is limited, due to challenges such as factual inaccuracies, reasoning abilities, and lack grounding in real-world experience. In this study, we present ClinicalGPT, a language model explicitly designed and optimized for clinical scenarios. By incorporating extensive and diverse real-world data, such as medical records, domain-specific knowledge, and multi-round dialogue consultations in the training process, ClinicalGPT is better prepared to handle multiple clinical task. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes medical knowledge question-answering, medical exams, patient consultations, and diagnostic analysis of medical records. Our results demonstrate that ClinicalGPT significantly outperforms other models in these tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in adapting large language models to the critical domain of healthcare.",
    "HuaTuoGPT, towards taming language model to be a doctor": "In this paper, we present HuatuoGPT, a large language model (LLM) for medical consultation. The core recipe of HuatuoGPT is to leverage both \\textit{distilled data from ChatGPT} and \\textit{real-world data from doctors} in the supervised fine-tuned stage. The responses of ChatGPT are usually detailed, well-presented and informative while it cannot perform like a doctor in many aspects, e.g. for integrative diagnosis. We argue that real-world data from doctors would be complementary to distilled data in the sense the former could tame a distilled language model to perform like doctors. To better leverage the strengths of both data, we train a reward model to align the language model with the merits that both data bring, following an RLAIF (reinforced learning from AI feedback) fashion. To evaluate and benchmark the models, we propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme (including automatic and manual metrics). Experimental results demonstrate that HuatuoGPT achieves state-of-the-art results in performing medical consultation among open-source LLMs in GPT-4 evaluation, human evaluation, and medical benchmark datasets. It is worth noting that by using additional real-world data and RLAIF, the distilled language model (i.e., HuatuoGPT) outperforms its teacher model ChatGPT in most cases. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT}. The online demo is available at \\url{https://www.HuatuoGPT.cn/}.",
    "BioMedGPT: open multimodal generative pre-trained transformer for biomedicine": "Foundation models (FMs) have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in many domains. Nevertheless, general-purpose FMs often face challenges when confronted with domain-specific problems, due to their limited access to the proprietary training data in a particular domain. In biomedicine, there are various biological modalities, such as molecules, proteins, and cells, which are encoded by the language of life and exhibit significant modality gaps with human natural language. In this paper, we introduce BioMedGPT, an open multimodal generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) for biomedicine, to bridge the gap between the language of life and human natural language. BioMedGPT allows users to easily ``communicate'' with diverse biological modalities through free text, which is the first of its kind. BioMedGPT aligns different biological modalities with natural language via a large generative language model, namely, BioMedGPT-LM. We publish BioMedGPT-10B, which unifies the feature spaces of molecules, proteins, and natural language via encoding and alignment. Through fine-tuning, BioMedGPT-10B outperforms or is on par with human and significantly larger general-purpose foundation models on the biomedical QA task. It also demonstrates promising performance in the molecule QA and protein QA tasks, which could greatly accelerate the discovery of new drugs and therapeutic targets. In addition, BioMedGPT-LM-7B is the first large generative language model based on Llama2 in the biomedical domain, therefore is commercial friendly. Both BioMedGPT-10B and BioMedGPT-LM-7B are open-sourced to the research community. In addition, we publish the datasets that are meticulously curated for the alignment of multi-modalities, i.e., PubChemQA and UniProtQA. All the models, codes, and datasets are available at \\url{https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed}.",
    "Gpt-4 for information retrieval and comparison of medical oncology guidelines": "Oncologists face increasingly complex clinical decision-making processes as new cancer therapies are approved and treatment guidelines are revised at an unprecedented rate. With the aim of improving oncologists’ efficiency and supporting their adherence to the most recent treatment recommendations, we evaluated the use of the large language model generative pretrained transformer 4 (GPT-4) to interpret guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society for Medical Oncology. The ability of GPT-4 to answer clinically relevant questions regarding the management of patients with pancreatic cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma was assessed. We also assessed GPT-4 outputs with and without retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which provided additional knowledge to the model, and then manually compared the results with the original guideline documents. GPT-4 with RAG provided correct responses in 84% of cases (of 218 statements, 184 were correct, 30 were inaccurate, and 4 were wrong). GPT-4 without RAG provided correct responses in only 57% of cases (of 163 statements, 93 were correct, 29 were inaccurate, and 41 were wrong). We showed that GPT-4, when enhanced with additional clinical information through RAG, can accurately identify detailed similarities and disparities in diagnostic and treatment proposals across different authoritative sources.",
    "MEDITRON-70B: scaling medical pretraining for large language models": "Large language models (LLMs) can potentially democratize access to medical knowledge. While many efforts have been made to harness and improve LLMs' medical knowledge and reasoning capacities, the resulting models are either closed-source (e.g., PaLM, GPT-4) or limited in scale (<= 13B parameters), which restricts their abilities. In this work, we improve access to large-scale medical LLMs by releasing MEDITRON: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B parameters adapted to the medical domain. MEDITRON builds on Llama-2 (through our adaptation of Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed trainer), and extends pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines. Evaluations using four major medical benchmarks show significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines before and after task-specific finetuning. Overall, MEDITRON achieves a 6% absolute performance gain over the best public baseline in its parameter class and 3% over the strongest baseline we finetuned from Llama-2. Compared to closed-source LLMs, MEDITRON-70B outperforms GPT-3.5 and Med-PaLM and is within 5% of GPT-4 and 10% of Med-PaLM-2. We release our code for curating the medical pretraining corpus and the MEDITRON model weights to drive open-source development of more capable medical LLMs.",
    "Advancing multimodal medical capabilities of Gemini": "Many clinical tasks require an understanding of specialized data, such as medical images and genomics, which is not typically found in general-purpose large multimodal models. Building upon Gemini's multimodal models, we develop several models within the new Med-Gemini family that inherit core capabilities of Gemini and are optimized for medical use via fine-tuning with 2D and 3D radiology, histopathology, ophthalmology, dermatology and genomic data. Med-Gemini-2D sets a new standard for AI-based chest X-ray (CXR) report generation based on expert evaluation, exceeding previous best results across two separate datasets by an absolute margin of 1% and 12%, where 57% and 96% of AI reports on normal cases, and 43% and 65% on abnormal cases, are evaluated as\"equivalent or better\"than the original radiologists' reports. We demonstrate the first ever large multimodal model-based report generation for 3D computed tomography (CT) volumes using Med-Gemini-3D, with 53% of AI reports considered clinically acceptable, although additional research is needed to meet expert radiologist reporting quality. Beyond report generation, Med-Gemini-2D surpasses the previous best performance in CXR visual question answering (VQA) and performs well in CXR classification and radiology VQA, exceeding SoTA or baselines on 17 of 20 tasks. In histopathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology image classification, Med-Gemini-2D surpasses baselines across 18 out of 20 tasks and approaches task-specific model performance. Beyond imaging, Med-Gemini-Polygenic outperforms the standard linear polygenic risk score-based approach for disease risk prediction and generalizes to genetically correlated diseases for which it has never been trained. Although further development and evaluation are necessary in the safety-critical medical domain, our results highlight the potential of Med-Gemini across a wide range of medical tasks.",
    "Can large language models reason about medical questions?": "Although large language models (LLMs) often produce impressive outputs, it remains unclear how they perform in real-world scenarios requiring strong reasoning skills and expert domain knowledge. We set out to investigate whether close- and open-source models (GPT-3.5, LLama-2, etc.) can be applied to answer and reason about difficult real-world-based questions. We focus on three popular medical benchmarks (MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA) and multiple prompting scenarios: Chain-of-Thought (CoT, think step-by-step), few-shot and retrieval augmentation. Based on an expert annotation of the generated CoTs, we found that InstructGPT can often read, reason and recall expert knowledge. Last, by leveraging advances in prompt engineering (few-shot and ensemble methods), we demonstrated that GPT-3.5 not only yields calibrated predictive distributions, but also reaches the passing score on three datasets: MedQA-USMLE 60.2%, MedMCQA 62.7% and PubMedQA 78.2%. Open-source models are closing the gap: Llama-2 70B also passed the MedQA-USMLE with 62.5% accuracy.",
    "Conversational disease diagnosis via external planner-controlled large language models": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has brought unprecedented possibilities for artificial intelligence (AI) based medical diagnosis. However, the application perspective of LLMs in real diagnostic scenarios is still unclear because they are not adept at collecting patient data proactively. This study presents a LLM-based diagnostic system that enhances planning capabilities by emulating doctors. Our system involves two external planners to handle planning tasks. The first planner employs a reinforcement learning approach to formulate disease screening questions and conduct initial diagnoses. The second planner uses LLMs to parse medical guidelines and conduct differential diagnoses. By utilizing real patient electronic medical record data, we constructed simulated dialogues between virtual patients and doctors and evaluated the diagnostic abilities of our system. We demonstrated that our system obtained impressive performance in both disease screening and differential diagnoses tasks. This research represents a step towards more seamlessly integrating AI into clinical settings, potentially enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of medical diagnostics.",
    "Automated clinical coding: what, why, and where we are?": "Clinical coding is the task of transforming medical information in a patient’s health records into structured codes so that they can be used for statistical analysis. This is a cognitive and time-consuming task that follows a standard process in order to achieve a high level of consistency. Clinical coding could potentially be supported by an automated system to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the process. We introduce the idea of automated clinical coding and summarise its challenges from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), based on the literature, our project experience over the past two and half years (late 2019–early 2022), and discussions with clinical coding experts in Scotland and the UK. Our research reveals the gaps between the current deep learning-based approach applied to clinical coding and the need for explainability and consistency in real-world practice. Knowledge-based methods that represent and reason the standard, explainable process of a task may need to be incorporated into deep learning-based methods for clinical coding. Automated clinical coding is a promising task for AI, despite the technical and organisational challenges. Coders are needed to be involved in the development process. There is much to achieve to develop and deploy an AI-based automated system to support coding in the next five years and beyond."

    "Large language models in medicine": "Large language models (LLMs) can respond to free-text queries without being specifically trained in the task in question, causing excitement and concern about their use in healthcare settings. ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot produced through sophisticated fine-tuning of an LLM, and other tools are emerging through similar developmental processes. Here we outline how LLM applications such as ChatGPT are developed, and we discuss how they are being leveraged in clinical settings. We consider the strengths and limitations of LLMs and their potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical, educational and research work in medicine. LLM chatbots have already been deployed in a range of biomedical contexts, with impressive but mixed results. This review acts as a primer for interested clinicians, who will determine if and how LLM technology is used in healthcare for the benefit of patients and practitioners.",
    "ChatGPT: the future of discharge summaries?": "ChatGPT (Open AI, San Francisco, CA, USA) has taken the world by storm.1 Released to the public in November, 2022, ChatGPT is based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology and trained on data from the internet written by humans, including conversations. This AI-powered chatbot has vast capabilities ranging from poem composition, essay writing, solving coding issues, and explanation of complex concepts including “how can we fix the UK National Health Service?” Some consider that ChatGPT has advanced the online search to the next level;2 the program offers rapid and in-depth understanding of complex matters and generates custom responses in a conversational manner to the exact question asked, recalling its own previous responses. Although still only a research preview, ChatGPT has shown impressive performance across multiple use cases. One potential area of ChatGPT's application could be to generate discharge summaries. Composition of high-quality discharge summaries containing the requisite information can be time consuming, with the burden usually falling on junior doctors. Therefore, when balanced against clinical commitments, discharge summaries are often left under-prioritised resulting in delays in patients' discharges or insufficient discharge summaries, which not only places pressure on an already stretched junior doctor workforce, but also presents potential patient safety issues in the transition of care from secondary to primary care.3 ChatGPT allows doctors to input a brief of the specific information to include, concepts to elaborate on, and guidance to explain, outputting a formal discharge summary in a matter of seconds (panel). Discharge summaries are an obvious choice for this technology because of their largely standardised format; this standardisation has previously been recognised through the creation of templates—eg, from the Royal College of Physicians.4 Automation of this process could therefore ease the work burden upon junior doctors allowing more time for the delivery of patient care and the seeking of training opportunities in often roles centered on service provision. ChatGPT could also improve the quality of the discharge summaries themselves, with previous literature showing discharge summaries that are written through traditional means often missing details.",
    "AI in health and medicine": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to broadly reshape medicine, potentially improving the experiences of both clinicians and patients. We discuss key findings from a 2-year weekly effort to track and share key developments in medical AI. We cover prospective studies and advances in medical image analysis, which have reduced the gap between research and deployment. We also address several promising avenues for novel medical AI research, including non-image data sources, unconventional problem formulations and human–AI collaboration. Finally, we consider serious technical and ethical challenges in issues spanning from data scarcity to racial bias. As these challenges are addressed, AI’s potential may be realized, making healthcare more accurate, efficient and accessible for patients worldwide.",
    "Leveraging a medical knowledge graph into large language models for diagnosis prediction": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and routine documentation practices play a vital role in patients’ daily care, providing a holistic record of health, diagnoses, and treatment. However, complex and verbose EHR narratives overload healthcare providers, risking diagnostic inaccuracies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their potential in diverse language tasks, their application in the healthcare arena needs to ensure the minimization of diagnostic errors and the prevention of patient harm. In this paper, we outline an innovative approach for augmenting the proficiency of LLMs in the realm of automated diagnosis generation, achieved through the incorporation of a medical knowledge graph (KG) and a novel graph model: D R .K NOWS , inspired by the clinical diagnostic reasoning process. We derive the KG from the National Library of Medicine’s Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), a robust repository of biomedical knowledge. Our method negates the need for pre-training and instead leverages the KG as an auxiliary instrument aiding in the interpretation and summarization of complex medical concepts. Using real-world hospital datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach of combining LLMs with KG has the potential to improve the accuracy of automated diagnosis generation. More importantly, our approach offers an explainable diagnostic pathway, edging us closer to the realization of AI-augmented diagnostic decision support systems.",
    "Towards accurate differential diagnosis with large language models": "An accurate differential diagnosis (DDx) is a cornerstone of medical care, often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to both assist and automate aspects of this process. In this study, we introduce an LLM optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a DDx alone or as an aid to clinicians. 20 clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: either assistance from search engines and standard medical resources, or LLM assistance in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted DDx prior to using the respective assistive tools. Our LLM for DDx exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% vs 33.6%, [p = 0.04]). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the DDx quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by our LLM (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared to clinicians without its assistance (36.1%) (McNemar's Test: 45.7, p<0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%) (4.75, p = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by our LLM arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without its assistance. Our study suggests that our LLM for DDx has potential to improve clinicians' diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients' access to specialist-level expertise.",

    "Matching patients to clinical trials with large language models": "Patient recruitment is challenging for clinical trials. We introduce TrialGPT, an end-to-end framework for zero-shot patient-to-trial matching with large language models. TrialGPT comprises three modules: it first performs large-scale filtering to retrieve candidate trials (TrialGPT-Retrieval); then predicts criterion-level patient eligibility (TrialGPT-Matching); and finally generates trial-level scores (TrialGPT-Ranking). We evaluate TrialGPT on three cohorts of 183 synthetic patients with over 75,000 trial annotations. TrialGPT-Retrieval can recall over 90% of relevant trials using less than 6% of the initial collection. Manual evaluations on 1,015 patient-criterion pairs show that TrialGPT-Matching achieves an accuracy of 87.3% with faithful explanations, close to the expert performance. The TrialGPT-Ranking scores are highly correlated with human judgments and outperform the best-competing models by 43.8% in ranking and excluding trials. Furthermore, our user study reveals that TrialGPT can reduce the screening time by 42.6% in patient recruitment. Overall, these results have demonstrated promising opportunities for patient-to-trial matching with TriaGPT.",
    "Interactive computer-aided diagnosis on medical image using large language models": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has advanced medical image analysis, while large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in clinical applications. However, LLMs struggle to interpret medical images, which are critical for decision-making. Here we show a strategy integrating LLMs with CAD networks. The framework uses LLMs’ medical knowledge and reasoning to enhance CAD network outputs, such as diagnosis, lesion segmentation, and report generation, by summarizing information in natural language. The generated reports are of higher quality and can improve the performance of vision-based CAD models. In chest X-rays, an LLM using ChatGPT improved diagnosis performance by 16.42 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art models, while GPT-3 provided a 15.00 percentage point F1-score improvement. Our strategy allows accurate report generation and creates a patient-friendly interactive system, unlike conventional CAD systems only understood by professionals. This approach has the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and patient communication.",
    "PLM-ICD: automatic ICD coding with pretrained language models": "Automatically classifying electronic health records (EHRs) into diagnostic codes has been challenging to the NLP community. State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a multi-label classification problem and proposed various architectures to model this problem. However, these systems did not leverage the superb performance of pretrained language models, which achieved superb performance on natural language understanding tasks. Prior work has shown that pretrained language models underperformed on this task with the regular fine-tuning scheme. Therefore, this paper aims at analyzing the causes of the underperformance and developing a framework for automatic ICD coding with pretrained language models. We spotted three main issues through the experiments: 1) large label space, 2) long input sequences, and 3) domain mismatch between pretraining and fine-tuning. We propose PLM-ICD, a framework that tackles the challenges with various strategies. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can overcome the challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multiple metrics on the benchmark MIMIC data. Our source code is available at https://github.com/MiuLab/PLM-ICD.",
    "DRG–LLaMA: tuning LLaMA model to predict diagnosis-related group for hospitalized patients": "In the U.S. inpatient payment system, the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) is pivotal, but its assignment process is inefficient. The study introduces DRG-LLaMA, an advanced large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on clinical notes to enhance DRGs assignment. Utilizing LLaMA as the foundational model and optimizing it through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 236,192 MIMIC-IV discharge summaries, our DRG-LLaMA -7B model exhibited a noteworthy macro-averaged F1 score of 0.327, a top-1 prediction accuracy of 52.0%, and a macro-averaged Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.986, with a maximum input token length of 512. This model surpassed the performance of prior leading models in DRG prediction, showing a relative improvement of 40.3% and 35.7% in macro-averaged F1 score compared to ClinicalBERT and CAML, respectively. Applied to base DRG and complication or comorbidity (CC)/major complication or comorbidity (MCC) prediction, DRG-LLaMA achieved a top-1 prediction accuracy of 67.8% and 67.5%, respectively. Additionally, our findings indicate that DRG-LLaMA ’s performance correlates with increased model parameters and input context lengths.",
    "ChatICD: prompt learning for few-shot ICD coding through ChatGPT": "Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding involves the automated assignment of diverse disease codes to clinical medical texts. It is considered as a multi-label classification task. Because most ICD codes are rare, the imbalanced distribution and small sample size issue make this task challenging. Inspired by the recent success of ChatGPT and prompt-based fine-tuning, this study proposes a model called ChatICD to address the issue of few-shot ICD coding. First, ChatGPT for data augumentation rephrases the descriptions of ICD codes into multiple samples. Then, ChatICD fine-tunes the pretrained model by generating prompt templates and label mapping words. We conduct an evaluation of ChatICD on benchmark datasets, namely MIMIC-III-50 and MIMIC-III-rare50. On the few-shot ICD coding task of MIMIC-III-rare50, ChatICD achieves macro-F1 and micro-F1 of 35.8% and 38.2% respectively, which is a 5.4% and 5.6% improvement over the current best model.",
    "Surpassing GPT-4 medical coding with a two-stage approach": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) show potential for clinical applications, such as clinical decision support and trial recommendations. However, the GPT-4 LLM predicts an excessive number of ICD codes for medical coding tasks, leading to high recall but low precision. To tackle this challenge, we introduce LLM-codex, a two-stage approach to predict ICD codes that first generates evidence proposals using an LLM and then employs an LSTM-based verification stage. The LSTM learns from both the LLM's high recall and human expert's high precision, using a custom loss function. Our model is the only approach that simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art results in medical coding accuracy, accuracy on rare codes, and sentence-level evidence identification to support coding decisions without training on human-annotated evidence according to experiments on the MIMIC dataset.",
    "Exploring and distilling posterior and prior knowledge for radiology report generation": "Automatically generating radiology reports can improve current clinical practice in diagnostic radiology. On one hand, it can relieve radiologists from the heavy burden of report writing; On the other hand, it can remind radiologists of abnormalities and avoid the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Yet, this task remains a challenging job for data-driven neural networks, due to the serious visual and textual data biases. To this end, we propose a Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling approach (PPKED) to imitate the working patterns of radiologists, who will first examine the abnormal regions and assign the disease topic tags to the abnormal regions, and then rely on the years of prior medical knowledge and prior working experience accumulations to write reports. Thus, the PPKED includes three modules: Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE) and Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD). In detail, PoKE explores the posterior knowledge, which provides explicit abnormal visual regions to alleviate visual data bias; PrKE explores the prior knowledge from the prior medical knowledge graph (medical knowledge) and prior radiology reports (working experience) to alleviate textual data bias. The explored knowledge is distilled by the MKD to generate the final reports. Evaluated on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray datasets, our method is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art models on these two datasets.",
    "An iterative optimizing framework for radiology report summarization with ChatGPT": "The “Impression” section of a radiology report is a critical basis for communication between radiologists and other physicians. Typically written by radiologists, this part is derived from the “Findings” section, which can be laborious and error-prone. Although deep-learning-based models, such as bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT), have achieved promising results in automatic impression generation (AIG), such models often require substantial amounts of medical data and have poor generalization performance. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) have shown strong generalization capabilities and performance, but their performance in specific domains, such as radiology, remains under-investigated and potentially limited. To address this limitation, we propose ImpressionGPT, leveraging the contextual learning capabilities of LLMs through our dynamic prompt and iterative optimization algorithm to accomplish the AIG task. ImpressionGPT initially employs a small amount of domain-specific data to create a dynamic prompt, extracting contextual semantic information closely related to the test data. Subsequently, the iterative optimization algorithm automatically evaluates the output of LLMs and provides optimization suggestions, continuously refining the output results. The proposed ImpressionGPT model achieves superior performance of AIG task on both the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care - Chest X-ray database (MIMIC-CXR) and Open Access Biomedical Image Search Engine (OpenI) datasets without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning the LLMs. This work presents a paradigm for localizing LLMs that can be applied in a wide range of similar application scenarios, bridging the gap between general-purpose LLMs and the specific language processing needs of various domains.",
    "RadAdapt: radiology report summarization via lightweight domain adaptation of large language models": "We systematically investigate lightweight strategies to adapt large language models (LLMs) for the task of radiology report summarization (RRS). Specifically, we focus on domain adaptation via pretraining (on natural language, biomedical text, or clinical text) and via discrete prompting or parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our results consistently achieve best performance by maximally adapting to the task via pretraining on clinical text and fine-tuning on RRS examples. Importantly, this method fine-tunes a mere 0.32% of parameters throughout the model, in contrast to end-to-end fine-tuning (100% of parameters). Additionally, we study the effect of in-context examples and out-of-distribution (OOD) training before concluding with a radiologist reader study and qualitative analysis. Our findings highlight the importance of domain adaptation in RRS and provide valuable insights toward developing effective natural language processing solutions for clinical tasks.",

    "Enhancing surgical robots with embodied intelligence for autonomous ultrasound scanning": "Ultrasound robots are increasingly used in medical diagnostics and early disease screening. However, current ultrasound robots lack the intelligence to understand human intentions and instructions, hindering autonomous ultrasound scanning. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Ultrasound Embodied Intelligence system that equips ultrasound robots with the large language model (LLM) and domain knowledge, thereby improving the efficiency of ultrasound robots. Specifically, we first design an ultrasound operation knowledge database to add expertise in ultrasound scanning to the LLM, enabling the LLM to perform precise motion planning. Furthermore, we devise a dynamic ultrasound scanning strategy based on a \\textit{think-observe-execute} prompt engineering, allowing LLMs to dynamically adjust motion planning strategies during the scanning procedures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system significantly improves ultrasound scan efficiency and quality from verbal commands. This advancement in autonomous medical scanning technology contributes to non-invasive diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows.",
    "Large language models for robotics: opportunities, challenges, and perspectives": "Large language models (LLMs) have undergone significant expansion and have been increasingly integrated across various domains. Notably, in the realm of robot task planning, LLMs harness their advanced reasoning and language comprehension capabilities to formulate precise and efficient action plans based on natural language instructions. However, for embodied tasks, where robots interact with complex environments, text-only LLMs often face challenges due to a lack of compatibility with robotic visual perception. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging integration of LLMs and multimodal LLMs into various robotic tasks. Additionally, we propose a framework that utilizes multimodal GPT-4V to enhance embodied task planning through the combination of natural language instructions and robot visual perceptions. Our results, based on diverse datasets, indicate that GPT-4V effectively enhances robot performance in embodied tasks. This extensive survey and evaluation of LLMs and multimodal LLMs across a variety of robotic tasks enriches the understanding of LLM-centric embodied intelligence and provides forward-looking insights toward bridging the gap in Human-Robot-Environment interaction.",
    "SuFIA: language-guided augmented dexterity for robotic surgical assistants": "In this work, we present SuFIA, the first framework for natural language-guided augmented dexterity for robotic surgical assistants. SuFIA incorporates the strong reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with perception modules to implement high-level planning and low-level control of a robot for surgical sub-task execution. This enables a learning-free approach to surgical augmented dexterity without any in-context examples or motion primitives. SuFIA uses a human-in-the-loop paradigm by restoring control to the surgeon in the case of insufficient information, mitigating unexpected errors for mission-critical tasks. We evaluate SuFIA on four surgical sub-tasks in a simulation environment and two sub-tasks on a physical surgical robotic platform in the lab, demonstrating its ability to perform common surgical sub-tasks through supervised autonomous operation under challenging physical and workspace conditions.Project website: orbit-surgical.github.io/sufia",
    "Take a shot! natural language control of intelligent robotic X-ray systems in surgery": "Purpose The expanding capabilities of surgical systems bring with them increasing complexity in the interfaces that humans use to control them. Robotic C-arm X-ray imaging systems, for instance, often require manipulation of independent axes via joysticks, while higher-level control options hide inside device-specific menus. The complexity of these interfaces hinder “ready-to-hand” use of high-level functions. Natural language offers a flexible, familiar interface for surgeons to express their desired outcome rather than remembering the steps necessary to achieve it, enabling direct access to task-aware, patient-specific C-arm functionality. Methods We present an English language voice interface for controlling a robotic X-ray imaging system with task-aware functions for pelvic trauma surgery. Our fully integrated system uses a large language model (LLM) to convert natural spoken commands into machine-readable instructions, enabling low-level commands like “Tilt back a bit,” to increase the angular tilt or patient-specific directions like, “Go to the obturator oblique view of the right ramus,” based on automated image analysis. Results We evaluate our system with 212 prompts provided by an attending physician, in which the system performed satisfactory actions 97% of the time. To test the fully integrated system, we conduct a real-time study in which an attending physician placed orthopedic hardware along desired trajectories through an anthropomorphic phantom, interacting solely with an X-ray system via voice. Conclusion Voice interfaces offer a convenient, flexible way for surgeons to manipulate C-arms based on desired outcomes rather than device-specific processes. As LLMs grow increasingly capable, so too will their applications in supporting higher-level interactions with surgical assistance systems.",
    "Human-robot collaboration for healthcare: a narrative review": "Robotic applications have often quickly transitioned from industrial to social. Because of this, robots can now engage with people in a natural way and blend in with their surroundings. Due to the lack of medical professionals, growing healthcare costs, and the exponential rise in the population of vulnerable groups like the ill, elderly, and children with developmental disabilities, the use of social robots in the healthcare system is expanding. As a result, social robots are employed in the medical field to entertain and educate hospitalized patients about health issues, as well as to assist the elderly and sick. They are also employed in the dispensing of medications, rehabilitation, and emotional and geriatric care. Thus, social robots raise the standard and effectiveness of medical care. This article explains how patients and healthcare professionals collaborate with robots in the healthcare industry. The objectives of this collaboration are to resolve moral and legal concerns, improve patient outcomes, and improve healthcare delivery. It has a broad range of uses, including telemedicine, rehabilitation, and robotic surgical support. Human-robot interaction is the term used to describe interactions between social robots and people. Many obstacles stand in the way of human-robot interaction in healthcare, including safety concerns, acceptability issues, appropriateness, usefulness, and the worry that robots may replace human carers. In the end, these difficulties result in a poor adoption rate for robotic technology. As a result, the applications and difficulties of human-robot interaction in healthcare are thoroughly evaluated in this research. This study also reviews future safety prospects from human-robot interaction in healthcare, as well as ethical and usability issues including privacy, trust, and safety, and our aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of robots in healthcare, including their applications, benefits, challenges, and prospects, to facilitate a deeper understanding of this evolving field.",
    "Medical mT5: an open-source multilingual text-to-text LLM for the medical domain": "Research on language technology for the development of medical applications is currently a hot topic in Natural Language Understanding and Generation. Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) have recently been adapted to the medical domain, so that they can be used as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction. While these LLMs display competitive performance on automated medical texts benchmarks, they have been pre-trained and evaluated with a focus on a single language (English mostly). This is particularly true of text-to-text models, which typically require large amounts of domain-specific pre-training data, often not easily accessible for many languages. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by compiling, to the best of our knowledge, the largest multilingual corpus for the medical domain in four languages, namely English, French, Italian and Spanish. This new corpus has been used to train Medical mT5, the first open-source text-to-text multilingual model for the medical domain. Additionally, we present two new evaluation benchmarks for all four languages with the aim of facilitating multilingual research in this domain. A comprehensive evaluation shows that Medical mT5 outperforms both encoders and similarly sized text-to-text models for the Spanish, French, and Italian benchmarks, while being competitive with current state-of-the-art LLMs in English.",
    "Apollo: lightweight multilingual medical LLM towards democratizing medical AI to 6b people": "Despite the vast repository of global medical knowledge predominantly being in English, local languages are crucial for delivering tailored healthcare services, particularly in areas with limited medical resources. To extend the reach of medical AI advancements to a broader population, we aim to develop medical LLMs across the six most widely spoken languages, encompassing a global population of 6.1 billion. This effort culminates in the creation of the ApolloCorpora multilingual medical dataset and the XMedBench benchmark. In the multilingual medical benchmark, the released Apollo models, at various relatively-small sizes (i.e., 0.5B, 1.8B, 2B, 6B, and 7B), achieve the best performance among models of equivalent size. Especially, Apollo-7B is the state-of-the-art multilingual medical LLMs up to 70B. Additionally, these lite models could be used to improve the multi-lingual medical capabilities of larger models without fine-tuning in a proxy-tuning fashion. We will open-source training corpora, code, model weights and evaluation benchmark.",
    "BIMediX: bilingual medical mixture of experts LLM": "In this paper, we introduce BiMediX, the first bilingual medical mixture of experts LLM designed for seamless interaction in both English and Arabic. Our model facilitates a wide range of medical interactions in English and Arabic, including multi-turn chats to inquire about additional details such as patient symptoms and medical history, multiple-choice question answering, and open-ended question answering. We propose a semi-automated English-to-Arabic translation pipeline with human refinement to ensure high-quality translations. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Arabic medical LLMs. Furthermore, we introduce BiMed1.3M, an extensive Arabic-English bilingual instruction set covering 1.3 Million diverse medical interactions, resulting in over 632 million healthcare specialized tokens for instruction tuning. Our BiMed1.3M dataset includes 250k synthesized multi-turn doctor-patient chats and maintains a 1:2 Arabic-to-English ratio. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art Med42 and Meditron by average absolute gains of 2.5% and 4.1%, respectively, computed across multiple medical evaluation benchmarks in English, while operating at 8-times faster inference. Moreover, our BiMediX outperforms the generic Arabic-English bilingual LLM, Jais-30B, by average absolute gains of 10% on our Arabic medical benchmark and 15% on bilingual evaluations across multiple datasets. Our project page with source code and trained model is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/BiMediX .",
    "Improving biomedical abstractive summarisation with knowledge aggregation from citation papers": "Abstracts derived from biomedical literature possess distinct domain-specific characteristics, including specialised writing styles and biomedical terminologies, which necessitate a deep understanding of the related literature. As a result, existing language models struggle to generate technical summaries that are on par with those produced by biomedical experts, given the absence of domain-specific background knowledge. This paper aims to enhance the performance of language models in biomedical abstractive summarisation by aggregating knowledge from external papers cited within the source article. We propose a novel attention-based citation aggregation model that integrates domain-specific knowledge from citation papers, allowing neural networks to generate summaries by leveraging both the paper content and relevant knowledge from citation papers. Furthermore, we construct and release a large-scale biomedical summarisation dataset that serves as a foundation for our research. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves substantial improvements in abstractive biomedical text summarisation.",
    "Retrieval augmentation of large language models for lay language generation": "The complex linguistic structures and specialized terminology of expert-authored content limit the accessibility of biomedical literature to the general public. Automated methods have the potential to render this literature more interpretable to readers with different educational backgrounds. Prior work has framed such lay language generation as a summarization or simplification task. However, adapting biomedical text for the lay public includes the additional and distinct task of background explanation: adding external content in the form of definitions, motivation, or examples to enhance comprehensibility. This task is especially challenging because the source document may not include the required background knowledge. Furthermore, background explanation capabilities have yet to be formally evaluated, and little is known about how best to enhance them. To address this problem, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Lay Language (RALL) generation, which intuitively fits the need for external knowledge beyond that in expert-authored source documents. In addition, we introduce CELLS, the largest (63k pairs) and broadest-ranging (12 journals) parallel corpus for lay language generation. To evaluate RALL, we augmented state-of-the-art text generation models with information retrieval of either term definitions from the UMLS and Wikipedia, or embeddings of explanations from Wikipedia documents. Of these, embedding-based RALL models improved summary quality and simplicity while maintaining factual correctness, suggesting that Wikipedia is a helpful source for background explanation in this context. We also evaluated the ability of both an open-source Large Language Model (Llama 2) and a closed-source Large Language Model (GPT-4) in background explanation, with and without retrieval augmentation. Results indicate that these LLMs can generate simplified content, but that the summary quality is not ideal. Taken together, this work presents the first comprehensive study of background explanation for lay language generation, paving the path for disseminating scientific knowledge to a broader audience. Our code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/LinguisticAnomalies/pls_retrieval.",
    "Can large language models provide security & privacy advice? Measuring the ability of LLMs to refute misconceptions": "Users seek security & privacy (S&P) advice from online resources, including trusted websites and content-sharing platforms. These resources help users understand S&P technologies and tools and suggest actionable strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as trusted information sources. However, their accuracy and correctness have been called into question. Prior research has outlined the shortcomings of LLMs in answering multiple-choice questions and user ability to inadvertently circumvent model restrictions (e.g., to produce toxic content). Yet, the ability of LLMs to provide reliable S&P advice is not well-explored. In this paper, we measure their ability to refute popular S&P misconceptions that the general public holds. We first study recent academic literature to curate a dataset of over a hundred S&P-related misconceptions across six different topics. We then query two popular LLMs (Bard and ChatGPT) and develop a labeling guide to evaluate their responses to these misconceptions. To comprehensively evaluate their responses, we further apply three strategies: query each misconception multiple times, generate and query their paraphrases, and solicit source URLs of the responses. Both models demonstrate, on average, a 21.3% non-negligible error rate, incorrectly supporting popular S&P misconceptions. The error rate increases to 32.6% when we repeatedly query LLMs with the same or paraphrased misconceptions. We also expose that models may partially support a misconception or remain noncommittal, refusing a firm stance on misconceptions. Our exploration of information sources for responses revealed that LLMs are susceptible to providing invalid URLs ( for Bard and for ChatGPT) or point to unrelated sources ( returned by Bard and by ChatGPT). Our findings highlight that existing LLMs are not completely reliable for S&P advice and motivate future work in understanding how users can better interact with this technology.",
    "The advent of generative language models in medical education": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and generative language models (GLMs) present significant opportunities for enhancing medical education, including the provision of realistic simulations, digital patients, personalized feedback, evaluation methods, and the elimination of language barriers. These advanced technologies can facilitate immersive learning environments and enhance medical students' educational outcomes. However, ensuring content quality, addressing biases, and managing ethical and legal concerns present obstacles. To mitigate these challenges, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content, address potential biases, and develop guidelines and policies governing the use of AI-generated content in medical education. Collaboration among educators, researchers, and practitioners is essential for developing best practices, guidelines, and transparent AI models that encourage the ethical and responsible use of GLMs and AI in medical education. By sharing information about the data used for training, obstacles encountered, and evaluation methods, developers can increase their credibility and trustworthiness within the medical community. In order to realize the full potential of AI and GLMs in medical education while mitigating potential risks and obstacles, ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration are necessary. By collaborating, medical professionals can ensure that these technologies are effectively and responsibly integrated, contributing to enhanced learning experiences and patient care.",
    "Assessing the utilization of large language models in medical education: insights from undergraduate medical students": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be integrated into medical education. Among AI-based technology, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, Microsoft Bing, and Perplexity have emerged as powerful tools with capabilities in natural language processing. With this background, this study investigates the knowledge, attitude, and practice of undergraduate medical students regarding the utilization of LLMs in medical education in a medical college in Jharkhand, India. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was sent to 370 undergraduate medical students on Google Forms. The questionnaire comprised the following three domains: knowledge, attitude, and practice, each containing six questions. Cronbach’s alphas for knowledge, attitude, and practice domains were 0.703, 0.707, and 0.809, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients for knowledge, attitude, and practice domains were 0.82, 0.87, and 0.78, respectively. The average scores in the three domains were compared using ANOVA. Results A total of 172 students participated in the study (response rate: 46.49%). The majority of the students (45.93%) rarely used the LLMs for their teaching-learning purposes (chi-square (3) = 41.44, p < 0.0001). The overall score of knowledge (3.21±0.55), attitude (3.47±0.54), and practice (3.26±0.61) were statistically significantly different (ANOVA F (2, 513) = 10.2, p < 0.0001), with the highest score in attitude and lowest in knowledge. Conclusion While there is a generally positive attitude toward the incorporation of LLMs in medical education, concerns about overreliance and potential inaccuracies are evident. LLMs offer the potential to enhance learning resources and provide accessible education, but their integration requires further planning. Further studies are required to explore the long-term impact of LLMs in diverse educational contexts.",

    "Iteratively refined ChatGPT outperforms clinical mentors in generating high-quality interprofessional education clinical scenarios: a comparative study": "Background Interprofessional education (IPE) is crucial for fostering teamwork among healthcare professionals. However, its implementation is hampered by the scarcity of multidisciplinary faculty and scheduling conflicts. In response to these issues, existing AI tools such as ChatGPT have struggled to generate high-quality clinical scenarios independently. This study investigates the efficacy of ChatGPT-4o, an advanced version of the artificial intelligence model ChatGPT, enhanced by novel methodological innovations, to overcome these barriers. Methods This comparative study assessed clinical scenarios generated by ChatGPT using two different strategies—Standard Prompt and Iterative Refinement—against those crafted by clinical mentors. The Iterative Refinement method, inspired by the clinical scenario generation process itself, involves a cyclic process of evaluation and feedback, closely mimicking clinical case discussions among professionals. Scenarios were evaluated for time efficiency and quality, measured through the Interprofessional Quality Score (IQS). Assessments were blinded and involved multidisciplinary experts and students, with statistical analysis performed using independent samples t-tests and χ² tests. Results Scenarios developed using the Iterative Refinement strategy were completed significantly faster than those by clinical mentors and achieved higher or equivalent IQS. Notably, these scenarios matched or surpassed the quality of those created by humans, particularly in areas such as appropriate challenge and student engagement. Conversely, scenarios generated via the Standard Prompt method exhibited lower accuracy and various other deficiencies. Blinded attribution assessments by students further demonstrated that scenarios developed through Iterative Refinement were often indistinguishable from those created by human mentors. Conclusions Employing ChatGPT with iterative refinement and role-playing strategies produces clinical scenarios that, in some areas, surpass those developed by clinical mentors. This approach reduces the need for extensive faculty involvement, highlighting AI's potential to closely align with educational standards and significantly improve IPE, especially in resource-limited settings.\n\n",

    "Chatbots and conversational agents in mental health: a review of the psychiatric landscape": "Objective: The aim of this review was to explore the current evidence for conversational agents or chatbots in the field of psychiatry and their role in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses. Methods: A systematic literature search in June 2018 was conducted in PubMed, EmBase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included that involved a chatbot in a mental health setting focusing on populations with or at high risk of developing depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders. Results: From the selected databases, 1466 records were retrieved and 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included from reference list screening for a total of 10 included studies. Overall, potential for conversational agents in psychiatric use was reported to be high across all studies. In particular, conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in psychiatric treatment. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents. Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research, the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric treatment.",
    "Tell me, what are you most afraid of? Exploring the effects of agent representation on information disclosure in human–chatbot interaction": "Self-disclosure counts as a key factor influencing successful health treatment, particularly when it comes to building a functioning patient-therapist-connection. To this end, the use of chatbots may be considered a promising puzzle piece that helps foster respective information provision. Several studies have shown that people disclose more information when they are interacting with a chatbot than when they are interacting with another human being. If and how the chatbot is embodied, however, seems to play an important role influencing the extent to which information is disclosed. Here, research shows that people disclose less if the chatbot is embodied with a human avatar in comparison to a chatbot without embodiment. Still, there is only little information available as to whether it is the embodiment with a human face that inhibits disclosure, or whether any type of face will reduce the amount of shared information. The study presented in this paper thus aims to investigate how the type of chatbot embodiment influences self-disclosure in human-chatbot-interaction. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in which $n=178$ participants were asked to interact with one of three settings of a chatbot app. In each setting, the humanness of the chatbot embodiment was different (i.e., human vs. robot vs. disembodied). A subsequent discourse analysis explored difference in the breadth and depth of self-disclosure. Results show that non-human embodiment seems to have little effect on self-disclosure. Yet, our data also shows, that, contradicting to previous work, human embodiment may have a positive effect on the breadth and depth of self-disclosure.",

    "A brief wellbeing training session delivered by a humanoid social robot: a pilot randomized controlled trial": "Mental health and psychological distress are rising in adults, showing the importance of wellbeing promotion, support, and technique practice that is effective and accessible. Interactive social robots have been tested to deliver health programs but have not been explored to deliver wellbeing technique training in detail. A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted to explore the feasibility of an autonomous humanoid social robot to deliver a brief mindful breathing technique to promote information around wellbeing. It contained two conditions: brief technique training (‘Technique’) and control designed to represent a simple wait-list activity to represent a relationship-building discussion (‘Simple Rapport’). This trial also explored willingness to discuss health-related topics with a robot. Recruitment uptake rate through convenience sampling was high (53%). A total of 230 participants took part (mean age = 29 years) with 71% being higher education students. There were moderate ratings of technique enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and likelihood to repeat the technique again. Interaction effects were found across measures with scores varying across gender and distress levels. Males with high distress and females with low distress who received the simple rapport activity reported greater comfort to discuss non-health topics than males with low distress and females with high distress. This trial marks a notable step towards the design and deployment of an autonomous wellbeing intervention to investigate the impact of a brief robot-delivered mindfulness training program for a sub-clinical population.",
    "Psy-LLM: scaling up global mental health psychological services with AI-based large language models": "The demand for psychological counselling has grown significantly in recent years, particularly with the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has heightened the need for timely and professional mental health support. Online psychological counselling has emerged as the predominant mode of providing services in response to this demand. In this study, we propose the Psy-LLM framework, an AI-based assistive tool leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for question-answering in psychological consultation settings to ease the demand for mental health professions. Our framework combines pre-trained LLMs with real-world professional Q\\&A from psychologists and extensively crawled psychological articles. The Psy-LLM framework serves as a front-end tool for healthcare professionals, allowing them to provide immediate responses and mindfulness activities to alleviate patient stress. Additionally, it functions as a screening tool to identify urgent cases requiring further assistance. We evaluated the framework using intrinsic metrics, such as perplexity, and extrinsic evaluation metrics, with human participant assessments of response helpfulness, fluency, relevance, and logic. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psy-LLM framework in generating coherent and relevant answers to psychological questions. This article discusses the potential and limitations of using large language models to enhance mental health support through AI technologies.",
    "PsyChat: a client-centric dialogue system for mental health support": "Dialogue systems are increasingly integrated into mental health support to help clients facilitate exploration, gain insight, take action, and ultimately heal themselves. A practical and user-friendly dialogue system should be client-centric, focusing on the client’s behaviors. However, existing dialogue systems publicly available for mental health support often concentrate solely on the counselor’s strategies rather than the behaviors expressed by clients. This can lead to unreasonable or inappropriate counseling strategies and corresponding responses generated by the dialogue system. To address this issue, we propose PsyChat, a client-centric dialogue system that provides psychological support through online chat. The client-centric dialogue system comprises five modules: client behavior recognition, counselor strategy selection, input packer, response generator, and response selection. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed dialogue system for real-life mental health support. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that the dialogue system can predict the client’s behaviors, select appropriate counselor strategies, and generate accurate and suitable responses.",
    "Mental-LLM: leveraging large language models for mental health prediction via online text data": "The recent technology boost of large language models (LLMs) has empowered a variety of applications. However, there is very little research on understanding and improving LLMs’ capability for the mental health domain. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs, including Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, and GPT-3.5, on various mental health prediction tasks via online text data. We conduct a wide range of experiments, covering zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction finetuning. The results indicate the promising yet limited performance of LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot prompt designs for mental health tasks. More importantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning can significantly boost the performance of LLMs for all tasks simultaneously. Our best-finetuned model, Mental-Alpaca, outperforms GPT-3.5 (25 times bigger) by 16.7% on balanced accuracy and performs on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific model. We summarize our findings into a set of action guidelines for future researchers, engineers, and practitioners on how to empower LLMs with better mental health domain knowledge and become an expert in mental health prediction tasks.",
    "Understanding the benefits and challenges of using large language model-based conversational agents for mental well-being support": "Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLM) have increasingly been utilized in the realm of mental well-being support. However, the implications and outcomes associated with their usage in such a critical field remain somewhat ambiguous and unexplored. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 120 posts, encompassing 2917 user comments, drawn from the most popular subreddit focused on mental health support applications powered by large language models (u/Replika). This exploration aimed to shed light on the advantages and potential pitfalls associated with the integration of these sophisticated models in conversational agents intended for mental health support. We found the app (Replika) beneficial in offering on-demand, non-judgmental support, boosting user confidence, and aiding self-discovery. Yet, it faced challenges in filtering harmful content, sustaining consistent communication, remembering new information, and mitigating users' overdependence. The stigma attached further risked isolating users socially. We strongly assert that future researchers and designers must thoroughly evaluate the appropriateness of employing LLMs for mental well-being support, ensuring their responsible and effective application.",
    "Challenges of large language models for mental health counseling": "The global mental health crisis is looming with a rapid increase in mental disorders, limited resources, and the social stigma of seeking treatment. As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, large language models (LLMs) capable of understanding and generating human-like text may be used in supporting or providing psychological counseling. However, the application of LLMs in the mental health domain raises concerns regarding the accuracy, effectiveness, and reliability of the information provided. This paper investigates the major challenges associated with the development of LLMs for psychological counseling, including model hallucination, interpretability, bias, privacy, and clinical effectiveness. We explore potential solutions to these challenges that are practical and applicable to the current paradigm of AI. From our experience in developing and deploying LLMs for mental health, AI holds a great promise for improving mental health care, if we can carefully navigate and overcome pitfalls of LLMs.",
    "Healthcare Copilot: eliciting the power of general LLMs for medical consultation": "The copilot framework, which aims to enhance and tailor large language models (LLMs) for specific complex tasks without requiring fine-tuning, is gaining increasing attention from the community. In this paper, we introduce the construction of a Healthcare Copilot designed for medical consultation. The proposed Healthcare Copilot comprises three main components: 1) the Dialogue component, responsible for effective and safe patient interactions; 2) the Memory component, storing both current conversation data and historical patient information; and 3) the Processing component, summarizing the entire dialogue and generating reports. To evaluate the proposed Healthcare Copilot, we implement an auto-evaluation scheme using ChatGPT for two roles: as a virtual patient engaging in dialogue with the copilot, and as an evaluator to assess the quality of the dialogue. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed Healthcare Copilot significantly enhances the capabilities of general LLMs for medical consultations in terms of inquiry capability, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of each individual module in the Healthcare Copilot. Code will be made publicly available on GitHub.",
    "Towards conversational diagnostic AI": "At the heart of medicine lies the physician-patient dialogue, where skillful history-taking paves the way for accurate diagnosis, effective management, and enduring trust. Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility, consistency, and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians' expertise is an outstanding grand challenge. Here, we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a Large Language Model (LLM) based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a novel self-play based simulated environment with automated feedback mechanisms for scaling learning across diverse disease conditions, specialties, and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically-meaningful axes of performance including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication skills, and empathy. We compared AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient actors in the style of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). The study included 149 case scenarios from clinical providers in Canada, the UK, and India, 20 PCPs for comparison with AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 28 of 32 axes according to specialist physicians and 24 of 26 axes according to patient actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with appropriate caution. Clinicians were limited to unfamiliar synchronous text-chat which permits large-scale LLM-patient interactions but is not representative of usual clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI."

    "Large language models encode clinical knowledge": "Med-PaLM, a state-of-the-art large language model for medicine, is introduced and evaluated across several medical question answering tasks, demonstrating the promise of these models in this domain. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, but the bar for clinical applications is high. Attempts to assess the clinical knowledge of models typically rely on automated evaluations based on limited benchmarks. Here, to address these limitations, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six existing medical question answering datasets spanning professional medicine, research and consumer queries and a new dataset of medical questions searched online, HealthSearchQA. We propose a human evaluation framework for model answers along multiple axes including factuality, comprehension, reasoning, possible harm and bias. In addition, we evaluate Pathways Language Model^ 1 (PaLM, a 540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM^ 2 on MultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA^ 3 , MedMCQA^ 4 , PubMedQA^ 5 and Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) clinical topics^ 6 ), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US Medical Licensing Exam-style questions), surpassing the prior state of the art by more than 17%. However, human evaluation reveals key gaps. To resolve this, we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for aligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show that comprehension, knowledge recall and reasoning improve with model scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of LLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal limitations of today’s models, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method development in creating safe, helpful LLMs for clinical applications.",
    "What disease does this patient have? A large-scale open domain question answering dataset from medical exams": "Open domain question answering (OpenQA) tasks have been recently attracting more and more attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community. In this work, we present the first free-form multiple-choice OpenQA dataset for solving medical problems, MedQA, collected from the professional medical board exams. It covers three languages: English, simplified Chinese, and traditional Chinese, and contains 12,723, 34,251, and 14,123 questions for the three languages, respectively. We implement both rule-based and popular neural methods by sequentially combining a document retriever and a machine comprehension model. Through experiments, we find that even the current best method can only achieve 36.7%, 42.0%, and 70.1% of test accuracy on the English, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese questions, respectively. We expect MedQA to present great challenges to existing OpenQA systems and hope that it can serve as a platform to promote much stronger OpenQA models from the NLP community in the future.",

    "Faithful AI in medicine: a systematic review with large language models and beyond": "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise in healthcare and medicine on being able to help with many aspects, from biological scientific discovery, to clinical patient care, to public health policy making. However, the potential risk of AI methods for generating factually incorrect or unfaithful information is a big concern, which could result in serious consequences. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the faithfulness problem in existing research on AI in healthcare and medicine, including analysis of the cause of unfaithful results, evaluation metrics, and mitigation methods. We will systematically review the recent progress in optimizing the factuality in various generative medical AI methods, including knowledge grounded large language models, text-to-text generation tasks such as medical text summarization, medical text simplification, multimodality-to-text generation tasks such as radiology report generation, and automatic medical fact-checking. The challenges and limitations of ensuring the faithfulness of AI-generated information in these applications, as well as forthcoming opportunities will be discussed. We expect this review to help researchers and practitioners understand the faithfulness problem in AI-generated information in healthcare and medicine, as well as the recent progress and challenges on related research. Our review can also serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners who are interested in applying AI in medicine and healthcare.",
    "TruthfulQA: measuring how models mimic human falsehoods": "We propose a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.",
    "HaluEval: a large-scale hallucination evaluation benchmark for large language models": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., content that conflicts with the source or cannot be verified by the factual knowledge. To understand what types of content and to which extent LLMs are apt to hallucinate, we introduce the Hallucination Evaluation benchmark for Large Language Models (HaluEval), a large collection of generated and human-annotated hallucinated samples for evaluating the performance of LLMs in recognizing hallucination. To generate these samples, we propose a ChatGPT-based two-step framework, i.e., sampling-then-filtering. Besides, we also hire some human labelers to annotate the hallucinations in ChatGPT responses. The empirical results suggest that ChatGPT is likely to generate hallucinated content in specific topics by fabricating unverifiable information (i.e., about $19.5\\%$ responses). Moreover, existing LLMs face great challenges in recognizing the hallucinations in texts. However, our experiments also prove that providing external knowledge or adding reasoning steps can help LLMs recognize hallucinations. Our benchmark can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval.",
    "Large language models are poor clinical decision-makers: a comprehensive benchmark": "The adoption of large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians has attracted remarkable attention. Existing works mainly adopt the close-ended question-answering (QA) task with answer options for evaluation. However, many clinical decisions involve answering open-ended questions without pre-set options. To better understand LLMs in the clinic, we construct a benchmark ClinicBench. We first collect eleven existing datasets covering diverse clinical language generation, understanding, and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we construct six novel datasets and clinical tasks that are complex but common in real-world practice, e.g., open-ended decision-making, long document processing, and emerging drug analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluation of twenty-two LLMs under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Finally, we invite medical experts to evaluate the clinical usefulness of LLMs"

    "A survey of large language models for healthcare: from data, technology, and applications to accountability and ethics": "The utilization of large language models (LLMs) in the Healthcare domain has generated both excitement and concern due to their ability to effectively respond to freetext queries with certain professional knowledge. This survey outlines the capabilities of the currently developed LLMs for Healthcare and explicates their development process, with the aim of providing an overview of the development roadmap from traditional Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) to LLMs. Specifically, we first explore the potential of LLMs to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of various Healthcare applications highlighting both the strengths and limitations. Secondly, we conduct a comparison between the previous PLMs and the latest LLMs, as well as comparing various LLMs with each other. Then we summarize related Healthcare training data, training methods, optimization strategies, and usage. Finally, the unique concerns associated with deploying LLMs in Healthcare settings are investigated, particularly regarding fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics. Our survey provide a comprehensive investigation from perspectives of both computer science and Healthcare specialty. Besides the discussion about Healthcare concerns, we supports the computer science community by compiling a collection of open source resources, such as accessible datasets, the latest methodologies, code implementations, and evaluation benchmarks in the Github. Summarily, we contend that a significant paradigm shift is underway, transitioning from PLMs to LLMs. This shift encompasses a move from discriminative AI approaches to generative AI approaches, as well as a shift from model-centered methodologies to data-centered methodologies. Also, we determine that the biggest obstacle of using LLMs in Healthcare are fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics.",
    "ChatGPT utility in healthcare education, research, and practice: systematic review on the promising perspectives and valid concerns": "ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational large language model (LLM). The potential applications of LLMs in health care education, research, and practice could be promising if the associated valid concerns are proactively examined and addressed. The current systematic review aimed to investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health care education, research, and practice and to highlight its potential limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in 51/60 (85.0%) records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and enhancing research equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care research (efficient analysis of datasets, code generation, literature reviews, saving time to focus on experimental design, and drug discovery and development); (3) benefits in health care practice (streamlining the workflow, cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine, and improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health care education including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were stated in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of originality, inaccurate content with risk of hallucination, limited knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity issues, and risk of infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce paradigm shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution considering its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT does not qualify to be listed as an author in scientific articles unless the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are revised or amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders in health care education, research, and practice is urgently needed. This will help to set a code of ethics to guide the responsible use of ChatGPT among other LLMs in health care and academia.",
    "Opportunities and challenges for ChatGPT and large language models in biomedicine and health": "ChatGPT has drawn considerable attention from both the general public and domain experts with its remarkable text generation capabilities. This has subsequently led to the emergence of diverse applications in the field of biomedicine and health. In this work, we examine the diverse applications of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in biomedicine and health. Specifically we explore the areas of biomedical information retrieval, question answering, medical text summarization, information extraction, and medical education, and investigate whether LLMs possess the transformative power to revolutionize these tasks or whether the distinct complexities of biomedical domain presents unique challenges. Following an extensive literature survey, we find that significant advances have been made in the field of text generation tasks, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. For other applications, the advances have been modest. Overall, LLMs have not yet revolutionized biomedicine, but recent rapid progress indicates that such methods hold great potential to provide valuable means for accelerating discovery and improving health. We also find that the use of LLMs, like ChatGPT, in the fields of biomedicine and health entails various risks and challenges, including fabricated information in its generated responses, as well as legal and privacy concerns associated with sensitive patient data. We believe this survey can provide a comprehensive and timely overview to biomedical researchers and healthcare practitioners on the opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT and other LLMs for transforming biomedicine and health.",
    "Multi-step jailbreaking privacy attacks on ChatGPT": "With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), many downstream NLP tasks can be well solved given appropriate prompts. Though model developers and researchers work hard on dialog safety to avoid generating harmful content from LLMs, it is still challenging to steer AI-generated content (AIGC) for the human good. As powerful LLMs are devouring existing text data from various domains (e.g., GPT-3 is trained on 45TB texts), it is natural to doubt whether the private information is included in the training data and what privacy threats can these LLMs and their downstream applications bring. In this paper, we study the privacy threats from OpenAI's ChatGPT and the New Bing enhanced by ChatGPT and show that application-integrated LLMs may cause new privacy threats. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments to support our claims and discuss LLMs' privacy implications.",
    "Jailbroken: how does LLM safety training fail?": "Large language models trained for safety and harmlessness remain susceptible to adversarial misuse, as evidenced by the prevalence of\"jailbreak\"attacks on early releases of ChatGPT that elicit undesired behavior. Going beyond recognition of the issue, we investigate why such attacks succeed and how they can be created. We hypothesize two failure modes of safety training: competing objectives and mismatched generalization. Competing objectives arise when a model's capabilities and safety goals conflict, while mismatched generalization occurs when safety training fails to generalize to a domain for which capabilities exist. We use these failure modes to guide jailbreak design and then evaluate state-of-the-art models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude v1.3, against both existing and newly designed attacks. We find that vulnerabilities persist despite the extensive red-teaming and safety-training efforts behind these models. Notably, new attacks utilizing our failure modes succeed on every prompt in a collection of unsafe requests from the models' red-teaming evaluation sets and outperform existing ad hoc jailbreaks. Our analysis emphasizes the need for safety-capability parity -- that safety mechanisms should be as sophisticated as the underlying model -- and argues against the idea that scaling alone can resolve these safety failure modes.",
    "The imperative for regulatory oversight of large language models (or generative AI) in healthcare": "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.",
    "New regulatory thinking is needed for AI-based personalised drug and cell therapies in precision oncology": "Until recently the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in precision oncology was confined to activities in drug development and had limited impact on the personalisation of therapy. Now, a number of approaches have been proposed for the personalisation of drug and cell therapies with AI applied to therapy design, planning and delivery at the patient’s bedside. Some drug and cell-based therapies are already tuneable to the individual to optimise efficacy, to reduce toxicity, to adapt the dosing regime, to design combination therapy approaches and, preclinically, even to personalise the receptor design of cell therapies. Developments in AI-based healthcare are accelerating through the adoption of foundation models, and generalist medical AI models have been proposed. The application of these approaches in therapy design is already being explored and realistic short-term advances include the application to the personalised design and delivery of drugs and cell therapies. With this pace of development, the limiting step to adoption will likely be the capacity and appropriateness of regulatory frameworks. This article explores emerging concepts and new ideas for the regulation of AI-enabled personalised cancer therapies in the context of existing and in development governance frameworks.",
    "Auditing large language models: a three-layered approach": "Large language models (LLMs) represent a major advance in artificial intelligence (AI) research. However, the widespread use of LLMs is also coupled with significant ethical and social challenges. Previous research has pointed towards auditing as a promising governance mechanism to help ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed in ways that are ethical, legal, and technically robust. However, existing auditing procedures fail to address the governance challenges posed by LLMs, which display emergent capabilities and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this article, we address that gap by outlining a novel blueprint for how to audit LLMs. Specifically, we propose a three-layered approach, whereby governance audits (of technology providers that design and disseminate LLMs), model audits (of LLMs after pre-training but prior to their release), and application audits (of applications based on LLMs) complement and inform each other. We show how audits, when conducted in a structured and coordinated manner on all three levels, can be a feasible and effective mechanism for identifying and managing some of the ethical and social risks posed by LLMs. However, it is important to remain realistic about what auditing can reasonably be expected to achieve. Therefore, we discuss the limitations not only of our three-layered approach but also of the prospect of auditing LLMs at all. Ultimately, this article seeks to expand the methodological toolkit available to technology providers and policymakers who wish to analyse and evaluate LLMs from technical, ethical, and legal perspectives.",
